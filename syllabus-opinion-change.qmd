# 3. *Opinion Change: Modeling and Measurement* {.unnumbered}

*Spring 2026 (March 30 – June 23)* 

This course explores **how opinions form, shift, and polarize**, and how these processes shape sustainability outcomes. We combine **cognitive science, sociology, anthropology, and network science** to develop models of opinion change and learn statistical tools to measure it.

### Course Overview

Opinions can determine whether societies **achieve sustainable futures** or become locked in harmful trajectories. From online echo chambers to institutional polarization, understanding opinion dynamics is essential for effective interventions.

Students will design **empirically motivated models** of social influence, explore how extremism and polarization emerge, and evaluate strategies to promote consensus or diversity of thought.


### Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, you will:

- Understand major theories of **opinion formation and change**  
- Model **social influence** using agent-based and analytical approaches  
- Use **network models** to study echo chambers and polarization  
- Apply **statistical techniques** to measure opinion change reliably  
- Design and evaluate **social interventions** targeting polarization  
- Develop transferable skills in **technical writing, data analysis, and computational modeling**
