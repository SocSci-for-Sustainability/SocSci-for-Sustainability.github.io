## About Matt Turner

![](Figures/cafecito-pic.png){.float-left width="200px"} 

I am a theoretical and computational social scientist dedicated to resilient, rigorous, and problem-focused social science. I combine the precision of physics and computation with the insight of behavioral science to make social systems more predictable, adaptable, and humane.

I currently serve as a Lecturer in Environmental Social Sciences at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, where I help organizations and institutions model and accelerate how innovations spread—turning social science into a competitive advantage for adaptation and growth.

From my early training in physics and mathematics, I learned to use equations to describe complex dynamics—and developed an intuition for constructing mechanistic models of real systems. As a professional software developer, I strengthened my engineering toolkit and expanded into economics, environmental systems, and the earth sciences. During my PhD, I integrated these strands through rigorous training in social, cognitive, and behavioral science—building a quantitative foundation for modeling collective behavior and decision-making.

As a Pandemic Preparedness Hub researcher, I founded Projeto Dourados, a transdisciplinary collaboration studying urban Indigenous infection dynamics in Brazil. The project reflects my broader commitment to scientific and cultural exchange between North and South America—particularly between Brazilians and Estadounidenses, who share the challenges of sustaining large, diverse democracies. My connection to Brazil began in 2008, when I learned Portuguese and conducted astrophysics research there.

Before earning my PhD in Cognitive and Information Sciences in 2021, I deliberately pursued breadth—moving across disciplines, sectors, and institutions to understand how ideas propagate and evolve. While many peers specialized narrowly, I built synthesis: linking methods from the physical and computational sciences with insights from the behavioral and social sciences. The work presented in this Book, Curriculum, and related materials continues that synthesis.

I am driven by a practical goal: to translate core principles of social science into scalable systems for innovation, adaptation, and coordination. This requires a working fluency in mathematics, computation, and theory—and the ability to build models that help organizations and institutions anticipate change and act effectively within it.


## About the Project

*Social Science for Sustainability by Matt Turner* emerged from the need for a
simple, but powerful and
interdisciplinary social science to teach sustainability researchers and 
students quantitative social science. This includes necessary computational and
cognitive science topics sustainability practicioners need to know because they
matter for decision making in partnerships, institutions, in governments, and
online.

I emphasize in the title that this only my take by including my name, *Matt Turner*. 
I want this to be anti-colonial. I am trying to liberate social science from
disciplinary gatekeepers, not trying to become a
gatekeeper myself. 

I want you to be inspired to create your own *Social Science
for Sustainability by {Your Name Here}*. In some social science disciplines, 
it seems there are some holy books that, convention states, must be cited and
whose approach must be adopted. If my version of *Social Science* doesn't work
for you, don't use it!  Make up your own and show how it helps. Or maybe suggest
ideas for this version.

That being said, I think the vision put forth in this project could be especially useful. 
I have put years into trying to understand the details of how social
science can help us in our existential crisis of accelerating unsustainability,
which perhaps has already spiraled beyond all control. 


## Closing Thought: Consilience

This work implements a method of consilient, strategic curation of
social science. Curation is a type of consolidation.
In terms of scientific theories, this means the theory uses fewer types of
imagined things, processes, or situations to predict real-world observations. 
For example, the theory of quantum mechanics consolidates physics research,
helping us understand research in atomic physics and chemistry can be explained
by a common set of mathematical models and computational tools.

When we consolidtate theories, in social science or physics, we get a default
benefit of having fewer ideas, or mental "things", we have to keep track of 
in our limited working memory. *Consilience* is the added benefit that
we often see unpredictably useful and aesthetically beautiful connections between 
what seemed to be disconnected scientific phenomena. In other words, 
a consilient theory is more than just the sum of its parts.
