# Introduction

Indigenous, local peoples of the South Pacific Islands and other coastal habitats have sustainably managed mangrove forests to dissipate storm surges and prevent erosion, mitigating potential costs of climate change since long before the anthropocene [@Alongi2002; @Nalau2018; @Pearson2020; @McNamara2020]. First peoples of western North America have similarly practiced prescribed burns to prevent destructive wildfires during times of drought for millennia [@Eisenberg2019; @Kolden2019]. Despite their long-known effectiveness, adaptive practices like these often fail to spread widely. Instead, international development agencies frequently advocate for the construction of seawalls, for example, even though seawalls can exacerbate flooding once breached and incur high maintenance costs [@Piggott-McKellar2020]. Inland forest management is beset by polarization among stakeholders [@Swette2023], resulting in devastating wildfires burning a buildup of fuels or greenhouse gas-intensive clearcuts.

Here we introduce what we dub *the puzzle of diffusion*: why do some effective, sustainable practices like mangrove forest management fail to diffuse broadly, while other less effective or even maladaptive practices become widespread (@fig-puzzle-of-diffusion)? To answer this, we answer some more basic questions along the way. First, how do people decide what to do, i.e., how does learning work? Second, what is the effect of identity on how well or how likely we are to learn from people of the same or different identity? Third, what is the effect of social structure, i.e., who knows whom, represented as a social network? Agent-based models are useful because they provide a framework for creating rigorous, mechanistic, concrete models of social diffusion of adaptations. They help us deal with the complexity of causation in the real world through strategic selection of causal input variables and model details, which, over several model time steps, lead to social emergent phenomena like the diffusion of climate change adaptations.

The focus of this course is developing agent-based models that can help us simplify complex combinations of cognitive and social factors to represent only the most relevant ones, and observe the effect of these on simulated outcomes such as the proportion of people adopting adaptive behaviors, or opinion extremism and polarization.

## Sustainability as Social Science's (Ethical) "Manhattan Project"

The agent-based modeling approach developed in this course provides a structured way to test the effectiveness of social *interventions* aimed at promoting sustainable behavior. An intervention is some structured introduction of a sustainable practice through education or other means with the intention of sparking the endogenous diffusion of the practice after direct instruction has ended. For example, @Airoldi2024 developed a public health intervention to improve health outcomes for residents of villages in rural Ecuador far from hospitals. Airoldi and Christakis educated residents over an extended period of time about hand washing and warning signs of pregnancy complications, then surveyed residents to see if those not involved in the initial intervention had learned the information from the intervention. Airoldi and Christakis's study was designed to test a hypothesis about whether the *friendship-nomination* strategy for forming the *seed set* of individuals selected for direct instruction from the intervention.

By formalizing and testing our assumptions about social dynamics, agent-based modeling supports better design and evaluation of policies and programs aimed at driving real-world change. This deductive, experimental approach allows us to explore how cooperation, coordination, identity, homophily, and influence affect the likelihood that beneficial behaviors will spread. In the coming chapters and associated problem sets we will analyze social learning of behaviors and social influence of opinions in various contexts. This could save serious resources. We could use computational models to test the hypothesis from @Airoldi2024 that friendship nominated seed sets indeed better sparked endogenous diffusion in many different social networks with different group structures, which would give us a more comprehensive understanding of when friendship nomination does well or not.

The goal is to build up a repertoire of agent-based modeling techniques for incorporating different assumptions about how social learning or influence work, whether group structure is important to these processes, and for modeling social network structure. This repertoire can then be applied to sustainability contexts of interest to understand how different sustainability intervention strategies, such as who should learn about sustainable adaptations first in an educational intervention or how best to assist stakeholder deliberations to reduce opinion polarization that can derail collective adaptation. To choose model components wisely requires an understanding of elements of sustainability, cognitive and social science, network science, and software engineering.

The [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/) help us focus and organize our work by providing concrete goals for evaluating progress towards sustainable development for all [@fig-sdg-vibe]. These goals include targets for institutional development that promotes basic conditions for human thriving (justice, equality, education, public health, and no poverty) so as to assemble and enable a critical mass of people to participate bringing about sustainable development. People cannot participate in sustainability if they suffer in poverty, from illness, or subjugation by authoritariansâ€“all but the most zealous environmental defenders will fight on when these basic needs are unmet. Since progress has been slower than necessary.

Sustainability, then, has several different dimensions, all of which contribute
to climate action and environmental protection. I have organized these goals
into the VIBE system to guide sustainability promotion where *Vibrant
Institutions* meet the *Basic* needs, including *Environmental and Ecological*
protection. The 17 goals and how they each help catch a VIBE are illustrated 
in [@fig-sdg-vibe]. 

Organizing and connecting our work to has two benefits. First, it helps us
identify which cognitive and social factors are at work in different
sustainability foci. Second, it expands the corpus of existing research on which
we draw to consolidate our social and cognitive theories of behavior change that
we will apply to sustainability interventions. While many of us in computational
social science know our work is important as basic science partly because we are
confident it can apply to real-world problems, it is not clear how. Part of this
problem seems to stem from the lack of a clear goal for this science beyond
evaluating alternative theories of social behavior. 

*Sustainability* serves as a
sort of never-ending Manhattan Project for social scientists, an ethically
praiseworthy pursuit that will provide a selection pressure on social science
frameworks or theories that theory-comparison goals cannot: our social science
frameworks, theories, and models should be maximally useful to the long-term
study of sustainability. That means simulations should be designed so the model
parameters and outcome measures are observable and could reasonably be measured
in the real-world. It means flexibly adopting different assumptions in different
cases, possibly sampling from different theories that, in a different context,
might make contrary predictions. In the next

## Social Science for Sustainability

Social science is immensely broad and complex comprised of numerous traditional
academic disciplines in their entirety, such as anthropology and sociology, with
contributions from several other traditional disciplines, including cognitive
science, engineering, and physics. We use the problem of promoting sustainable
practices via *interventions* to structure this work. Sustainability
interventions are eductaion campaigns to induce the diffusion
of certain adaptive, sustainable behaviors, such as in public health
[@Airoldi2024], microfinance to support gender equality at work, home, and
everywhere [@OConnor2018;@Clydesdale2023], and 
climate change adaptation via ecosystem protection [@Brooks2018;@McNamara2020]. 
Following the UN SDGs, we see that
this is quite a broad range of potential behaviors, which is actually a good
thing. It means that our conclusions could apply to a broad range of application
domains.

On reflection, social science for sustainability needs a science of how
adaptive, sustainable behaviors, opinions, and other socially-transmitted 
items diffuse from person to person, throughout a population, over time. I don't
know for sure, but it seems like this may be *the* fundamental problem in social
science, broadly understood. The puzzle of adaptation frames the 
overarching question of designing interventions: how best to jump-start a
self-sustaining process diffusing adaptive sustainable behaviors?

Computational social science is the use of mathematics and computers to
understand and model the mechanisms underlying social diffusion phenomena, 
such as the adoption of sustainable practices
or rising political extremism, and statistically analyze collective 
behavior data. We start here and for the first chapters of the book developing
formal and generative models of promoting widespread behavior 
change. When we come to opinion change, we arrive at a natural transition point
where theory necessarily meets practice to understand how to properly *measure*
opinion change in the real world, which *requires* statistical inference since
opinions are not directly measurable. We apply our techniques to show that 

Computational social science is a cognitive gadget to help us use social science
theory for reasoning about the effect of different cognitive capacities (e.g.,
adaptive social learning), social processes (e.g., rising extremism), and social
and natural environment constraints (e.g., social networks, wildfire risk). 
Too often in the history of social science, social science theory is not
presented mathematically, with squishy verbal explanations of theories and their
consequences instead of concrete, *rigorous* mathematical or computational 
statements, where rigorous means they are theoretically true under a set of
explicitly-specified assumptions. This
means that mechanisms have tended to be only vaguely specified, 
and changes in assumptions
cannot be quantitatively, let alone systematically, explored [@Turner2022].




## Social learning strategies

Human kind is set apart by powerful learning and reasoning capabilities [@Witt2024] that enable cultural transmission and accumulation of technologies and practices no other species matches [@Henrich2015]. For our sustainability models, we only need simple models of cognition and learning. It would never be practical to do psychological or cognitive tests in the context of sustainability interventions that targets large populations, for one thing, so we could never compare detailed cognitive assumptions or predictions with reality. For our purposes we will consider three general classes of learning strategy:

1.  **Success-biased learning**: Individuals are more likely to adopt behaviors perceived to be successful or beneficial.
2.  **Frequency-biased learning**: Individuals adopt behaviors because others are already doing them, creating a conformity effect.
3.  **Contagion**: Individuals copy behaviors simply by observing others performing them.

In the mangrove versus seawall example, success-biased learning might favor seawalls if influential external actors, who seem successful or wealthy, advocate for them, even if seawalls are ultimately less effective. Mangrove forests might become widely adopted if, on the other hand, frequency-biased learning predominates and many communities have adopted that method.

### Social learning models with example

To make this more concrete, we *formalize* (i.e., *give formulas for*) these three learning strategies as follows using the example in @fig-learning-illustration. In the example, there is one *focal agent* who is the one doing the observing/learning, labelled with the ID *1*, and three social network neighbors with IDs *2, 3,* and *4.* The focal agent is deciding whether or not to install residential solar. One of his neighbors has installed it, 2. Based on 1's perception, 2 is the wealthiest, represented by four dollar symbols. 3 is perceived to have one dollar and 4 has two dollars.

![Agent 1, the focal agent, is considering whether to install residential solar. The probability agent 1 installs residential solar depends on its social learning strategy.](Figures/clipboard-1340594084.png){#fig-learning-illustration width="700"}

#### Success-biased learning

In success-biased learning, learners first choose an interaction partner/teacher randomly weighted by observed fitness of their neighbors, which is a generic term for wealth, power, status, etc. In general for this case, the probability that learner $i$ chooses teacher $j$ is

$$
\Pr(i \text{ chooses } j) = \frac{f_j}{\sum_{k \in n_i} f_k}.
$$

The probability that $i$ adopts $A$ is then the sum of the probabilities of choosing each neighbor performing $A$ (contained in the set $m_i$),

$$
\Pr(i \text{ adopts } A) = \frac{\sum_{j \in m_i} f_j}{\sum_{k \in n_i} f_k}.
$$

In our example, only one neighbor installed residential solar with a fitness (i.e. *wealth* in this example) of 4, while the others have finess 1 and 2. Therefore, $\Pr(1 \text{ adopts } A) = \frac{4}{7}$.

#### Frequency-biased learning

In frequency-biased learning there is no interaction partner or teacher chosen. The probability of adoption is only given by the relative frequency of each behavior. The general expression is

$$
\Pr(i \text{ adopts } A) = \frac{|m_i|}{|n_i|}.
$$

In our example, then, the probability of installing residential solar under frequency-biased learning is $\frac{1}{3}$.

#### Contagion learning

In the contagion learning model, the focal agent's (i.e., the *learner*'s) *teacher* (i.e., interaction partner) is chosen at random. Then, the learner adopts the teacher's behavior with probability $\alpha$, the adoption rate. In this case, then, the probability that 1 adopts residential solar is

$$
\Pr(1 \text{ adopts solar}) = \alpha \Pr(1 \text{ selects 2 as teacher}) = \alpha \frac{1}{3}.
$$

More generally, for focal agent $i$ with the set of neighbors $n_i$ ($n_1 = \{2, 3, 4\}$ in the example), where $m_i$ is the set of neighbors who have adopted the adaptive behavior ($m_i = \{2\}$ in the example). We call the adaptive behavior $A$. The general probability of adoption in contagion learning is therefore

$$
\Pr(i \text{ adopts } A) = \frac{\alpha |m_i|}{|n_i|},
$$

where the $| \cdot |$ operator counts the number of elements in a set.

#### Combinations of learning models

There is no reason different learning models cannot be combined. The software we will use in this class, `socmod`, provides flexibility to the user to define their own learning models. The simplest combination of the three learning models above is to add an adoption rate to either frequency- or success-biased learning. In this approach, one could call the behavior selected by the models above could be considered *prospective* or *candidate* behavior to learn, then is actually learned with probability $\alpha$.

For another potentially useful modification, $\alpha$ could be defined at the individual level, say $\alpha_i$, or for *dyads* (i.e., a pair of interacting individuals) , $\alpha_{ij}$, where $i$ is still the focal agent learner, but we have added $j$, representing the selected teacher.

## Identity and Influence

Group identity critically influences social learning. Neuroscience research demonstrates that our brains distinctly respond to individuals identified as part of our group [@Cikara2014], as revealed through fMRI neural imaging (@fig-cikara-mri-image). This ability likely evolved because when humans first emerged about two million years ago, it was much more important for survival to be able to rapidly identify whether someone was a friend or foe based on group markers. Although group membership can affect how we respond to information learned from others, group membership itself is quite plastic, meaning who belongs to which group can be rapidly reconfigured. For example, neural signals of race-based group perception was observed to be suppressed and overridden when individuals were in mixed-race groups created by experimenters that competed against other mixed-race groups in an psychological experimental task [@VanBavel2008].

![Figure 1 reorganized with original caption from Cikara and Van Bavel (2014)](Figures/clipboard-735263139.png){#fig-cikara-mri-image width="800"}

Studies further show that group identity can strongly influence behavioral choices. For instance, experimental evidence reveals people resist adopting beneficial behaviors if associated with opposing political identities [@EhretConstantino2022], emphasizing how identity can create substantial barriers to sustainability. This general effect of group membership interfering with learning is called *outgroup aversion* [@Smaldino2017Adoption].

### Social networks, homophily, and core-periphery structure

Social structure can significantly impact behavioral diffusion, especially in core-periphery configurations. Core-periphery networks emerge as a response to risk and uncertainty, e.g., in food sharing networks [@Ready2018], so they are hypothesized to also be important in climate change adaptation transmission networks [@Jones2021]. Core-periphery networks can be created by setting appropriate group sizes and *homophily* levels in homophily network models [@Turner2023] or specifying certain connectivity probabilities to the *stochastic block matrix* algorithm for creating structured random graphs [@Rombach2014; @Milzman2023]. Homophily is the measure of how much more likely an individual is to socially connect within their own group versus with a member of a different group. Homophily can range from -1 to +1, where -1 represents no within-group connections and only between-group connections (i.e., *anti-homophily*); 0 represents an equal probability of within- and between-group connections, and +1 represents only within-group connections. We will define homophily as either a global or group-level variable, though homophily could vary individually as well. There are two types of homophily:

-   **Choice Homophily**: Individuals actively prefer interacting with similar others.
-   **Induced Homophily**: Social interactions limited by historical or external conditions like geography, profession, birthplace, etc.

These structural elements can significantly limit the diffusion of sustainable practices from peripheries, like the mangrove management on smaller islands, to central cores. However, as colleagues and I have showed, this core-periphery structure, defined by moderately high majority-group homophily can actually *promote* the diffusion of adaptations, provided the adaptation is practiced by the minority group [@Turner2023], as is the case for mangrove forest management or prescribed burns. 

Due to time restrictions we will not be able to analyze the effects of social networks in this tutorial.
