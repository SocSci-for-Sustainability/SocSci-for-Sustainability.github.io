# Introduction

Humans know how to adapt to climate change. Indigenous, local peoples of the
South Pacific Islands and other coastal habitats have sustainably managed
mangrove forests to dissipate storm surges and prevent erosion, mitigating
potential costs of climate change since long before the anthropocene
[@Alongi2002; @Nalau2018; @Pearson2020; @McNamara2020]. First peoples of western
North America have similarly practiced prescribed burns to prevent destructive
wildfires during times of drought for millennia [@Eisenberg2019; @Kolden2019].

Despite their effectiveness, adaptive practices like these often fail to spread
widely. Instead, development agencies advocate for the construction of
high-maintenance "grey infrastructure" like seawalls, even though seawalls can exacerbate flooding once breached [@Piggott-McKellar2020]. Inland forest management is beset by polarization among stakeholders [@Swette2023], resulting in devastating wildfires burning a buildup of fuels or greenhouse gas-intensive clearcuts.

The puzzle of adaptation
:::

Ultimately our goal is to develop design principles for educational campaigns to
promote viral sustainability. Achieving this requires we understand how behavior
and opinions spread between people. 
*Viral* sustainability means that sustainable practices or attitudes
continue to spread in a population following an educational campaign directly
instructing a set of individuals I call the *seed set*.

::: {.column-margin}
What I call the *seed set*, or just *seeds*, are often called the *targets* who
are *targeted* for direct instruction. For one notable example, @Airoldi2024 in
their study "target"ed residents of "176 villages in the isolated western
highlands of Hondouras"! I prefer non-violent prose since our language shapes
our thinking [@Lakoff1980;@Cibelli2016;@Regier2017].
:::

To predict how different educational campaign strategies affect outcomes we can
delineate four guiding questions:

1. How do people decide what to do, i.e., how does learning work?
2. How does identity affect social learning and influence? 
3. How do different social network structures affect adaptation diffusion? 
4. How to use computational modeling to deal with the complexity of social
   behavior?

The focus of this course is developing technical and domain expertise in social
science that can help us simplify complex combinations of cognitive and social
factors that affect whether sustainability "goes viral".


## Social Science for Sustainability

Social science is immensely broad and complex comprised of numerous traditional
academic disciplines in their entirety, such as anthropology and sociology, with
contributions from several other traditional disciplines, including cognitive
science, engineering, and physics. We use the problem of promoting sustainable
practices via *interventions* to structure this work. Sustainability
interventions are eductaion campaigns to induce the diffusion
of certain adaptive, sustainable behaviors, such as in public health
[@Airoldi2024], microfinance to support gender equality at work, home, and
everywhere [@OConnor2018;@Clydesdale2023], and 
climate change adaptation via ecosystem protection [@Brooks2018;@McNamara2020]. 
Following the UN SDGs, we see that
this is quite a broad range of potential behaviors, which is actually a good
thing. It means that our conclusions could apply to a broad range of application
domains.

On reflection, social science for sustainability needs a science of how
adaptive, sustainable behaviors, opinions, and other socially-transmitted 
items diffuse from person to person, throughout a population, over time. I don't
know for sure, but it seems like this may be *the* fundamental problem in social
science, broadly understood. The puzzle of adaptation frames the 
overarching question of designing interventions: how best to jump-start a
self-sustaining process diffusing adaptive sustainable behaviors?

Computational social science is the use of mathematics and computers to
understand and model the mechanisms underlying social diffusion phenomena, 
such as the adoption of sustainable practices
or rising political extremism, and statistically analyze collective 
behavior data. We start here and for the first chapters of the book developing
formal and generative models of promoting widespread behavior 
change. When we come to opinion change, we arrive at a natural transition point
where theory necessarily meets practice to understand how to properly *measure*
opinion change in the real world, which *requires* statistical inference since
opinions are not directly measurable. We apply our techniques to show that 

Computational social science is a cognitive gadget to help us use social science
theory for reasoning about the effect of different cognitive capacities (e.g.,
adaptive social learning), social processes (e.g., rising extremism), and social
and natural environment constraints (e.g., social networks, wildfire risk). 
Too often in the history of social science, social science theory is not
presented mathematically, with squishy verbal explanations of theories and their
consequences instead of concrete, *rigorous* mathematical or computational 
statements, where rigorous means they are theoretically true under a set of
explicitly-specified assumptions. This
means that mechanisms have tended to be only vaguely specified, 
and changes in assumptions
cannot be quantitatively, let alone systematically, explored [@Turner2022].

The [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/) help us focus and organize our work by providing concrete goals for evaluating progress towards sustainable development for all [@fig-sdg-vibe]. These goals include targets for institutional development that promotes basic conditions for human thriving (justice, equality, education, public health, and no poverty) so as to assemble and enable a critical mass of people to participate bringing about sustainable development. People cannot participate in sustainability if they suffer in poverty, from illness, or subjugation by authoritarians–all but the most zealous environmental defenders will fight on when these basic needs are unmet. Since progress has been slower than necessary.

Sustainability, then, has several different dimensions, all of which contribute
to climate action and environmental protection. I have organized these goals
into the VIBE system to guide sustainability promotion where *Vibrant
Institutions* meet the *Basic* needs, including *Environmental and Ecological*
protection. The 17 goals and how they each help catch a VIBE are illustrated 
in [@fig-sdg-vibe]. 

Organizing and connecting our work to has two benefits. First, it helps us
identify which cognitive and social factors are at work in different
sustainability foci. Second, it expands the corpus of existing research on which
we draw to consolidate our social and cognitive theories of behavior change that
we will apply to sustainability interventions. While many of us in computational
social science know our work is important as basic science partly because we are
confident it can apply to real-world problems, it is not clear how. Part of this
problem seems to stem from the lack of a clear goal for this science beyond
evaluating alternative theories of social behavior. 

*Sustainability* serves as a
sort of never-ending Manhattan Project for social scientists, an ethically
praiseworthy pursuit that will provide a selection pressure on social science
frameworks or theories that theory-comparison goals cannot: our social science
frameworks, theories, and models should be maximally useful to the long-term
study of sustainability. That means simulations should be designed so the model
parameters and outcome measures are observable and could reasonably be measured
in the real-world. It means flexibly adopting different assumptions in different
cases, possibly sampling from different theories that, in a different context,
might make contrary predictions.

## Social learning models

Human kind is set apart by powerful learning and reasoning capabilities
[@Witt2024] that enable cultural transmission and accumulation of technologies
and practices no other species matches [@Henrich2015]. For our sustainability
models, we only need simple models of cognition and learning. It would never be
practical to do psychological or cognitive tests in the context of
sustainability interventions that targets large populations, for one thing, so
we could never compare detailed cognitive assumptions or predictions with
reality. For our purposes we will consider three general classes of learning
strategy, with some liberty taken in switching up traditional terminologies in
the pursuit of a leaner, more descriptive semantic system for this framework.

We model the learning process as *contagion*, *conformity*, or *vicarity*: 

1.  **Contagion**: Someone observing a behavior copies that behavior at random
   with a given probability called the *adoption rate*.
1.  **Conformity**: People prefer doing more popular behaviors to less popular
   ones.
1.  **Vicarity**: People prefer learning from peers who are successful.
   "Success" here is strategically ambiguous—it could be in terms of happiness,
   mindfulness, spiritual connection, wealth, power, etc.

In the mangrove versus seawall example, vicarity could be harnessed to promote 
sustainable mangrove forest management if its benefits were widely known. If
instead conformist attitudes prevailed within an echo chamber of pro-seawall
actors, education may be of little help without stronger institutional support
of free, democratic, and self-interested choice.
## Identity and Influence

Group identity critically influences social learning. Neuroscience research demonstrates that our brains distinctly respond to individuals identified as part of our group [@Cikara2014], as revealed through fMRI neural imaging (@fig-cikara-mri-image). This ability likely evolved because when humans first emerged about two million years ago, it was much more important for survival to be able to rapidly identify whether someone was a friend or foe based on group markers. Although group membership can affect how we respond to information learned from others, group membership itself is quite plastic, meaning who belongs to which group can be rapidly reconfigured. For example, neural signals of race-based group perception was observed to be suppressed and overridden when individuals were in mixed-race groups created by experimenters that competed against other mixed-race groups in an psychological experimental task [@VanBavel2008].

![Figure 1 reorganized with original caption from Cikara and Van Bavel (2014)](Figures/clipboard-735263139.png){#fig-cikara-mri-image width="800"}

Studies further show that group identity can strongly influence behavioral choices. For instance, experimental evidence reveals people resist adopting beneficial behaviors if associated with opposing political identities [@EhretConstantino2022], emphasizing how identity can create substantial barriers to sustainability. This general effect of group membership interfering with learning is called *outgroup aversion* [@Smaldino2017Adoption].

## Identity, homophily, and social networks shape viral sustainability

Social structure can significantly impact behavioral diffusion, especially in core-periphery configurations. Core-periphery networks emerge as a response to risk and uncertainty, e.g., in food sharing networks [@Ready2018], so they are hypothesized to also be important in climate change adaptation transmission networks [@Jones2021]. Core-periphery networks can be created by setting appropriate group sizes and *homophily* levels in homophily network models [@Turner2023] or specifying certain connectivity probabilities to the *stochastic block matrix* algorithm for creating structured random graphs [@Rombach2014; @Milzman2023]. Homophily is the measure of how much more likely an individual is to socially connect within their own group versus with a member of a different group. Homophily can range from -1 to +1, where -1 represents no within-group connections and only between-group connections (i.e., *anti-homophily*); 0 represents an equal probability of within- and between-group connections, and +1 represents only within-group connections. We will define homophily as either a global or group-level variable, though homophily could vary individually as well. There are two types of homophily:

-   **Choice Homophily**: Individuals actively prefer interacting with similar others.
-   **Induced Homophily**: Social interactions limited by historical or external conditions like geography, profession, birthplace, etc.

These structural elements can significantly limit the diffusion of sustainable practices from peripheries, like the mangrove management on smaller islands, to central cores. However, as colleagues and I have showed, this core-periphery structure, defined by moderately high majority-group homophily can actually *promote* the diffusion of adaptations, provided the adaptation is practiced by the minority group [@Turner2023], as is the case for mangrove forest management or prescribed burns. 

## We don't observe "opinions": Why opinion influence is different from learning behaviors

Opinions are not behaviors. They cannot be directly observed, only *inferred
from* behavior. A person planting mangroves or conducting a prescribed burn
produces a visible, specific, measurable action. 
An "opinion" is only constructed in relation to some prompt, like survey
responses that political scientists use to poll the electorate on policies and
politicians [@Zaller1992].
Cognitive scientists and psychologists developed other ways to access peoples'
opinions, such as through the timing of keypresses to reveal racial prejudice 
in an implicit bias test [@Greenwald2009], or 
using computational linguistic analysis of sentiment analysis [@Cody2015]. 

Political polarization, when partisans radicalize, makes institutions freeze.
Sustainability needs strong institutions to ensure basic needs are met and basic
human rights are protected (see bottom row in @fig-sdg-vibe). 
To make things worse, polarization hampers
sustainability debates, actively obscuring moderate, win-win solutions and
elevating partisan policies. 

Indigenous practices we reviewed seem to be ignored at least partly 
because polarized opinions prevent their consideration and adoption. 
The same holds for coastal mangrove
restoration, renewable energy policy, basic conservation, and in numerous other
sustainability problems. People can
be—and often are—openly hostile to sustainability for reasons that have little
to do with evidence or experience. If opinions are the supposed bridge between
psychology and large-scale social shifts, then building strategies on flawed
opinion science is like trying to engineer a suspension bridge without knowing
how steel bends.

### Models and measurements of opinion change

Opinion science needs, but currently lacks, a tight integration of theoretical
and computational modeling and experimental design. Here I'll explain what we
need and how theory, modeling, and measurement complement one another through 
a case study applied to group polarization, which we expand on in more detail
in the [opinion change post in the Lecture
Notes](posts/opinion-change-models-measurement-2025-09-24/), soon to be another
chapter in this online book.

#### Models

On the modeling side, frameworks like DeGroot’s
consensus model or Macy’s Hopfield adaptations generate elegant dynamics of
attraction, repulsion, or indifference. But these are mechanisms acting on
theoretical constructs, not on directly measurable behaviors. On the measurement
side, researchers routinely treat ordinal data—Likert scales of “strongly agree”
to “strongly disagree”—as if they were continuous. This sleight of hand allows
ANOVAs and regressions to spit out “effects” that may be nothing more than
statistical artifacts. Replications don’t fix this; they repeat the same errors.
What we call “opinion change” is too often a reflection of our instruments, not
of anything happening in people’s minds.


#### Measurements

- To measure opinion change we need a rigorous method [@Liddell2018]


## Discussion 

Let's close this chapter by reviewing the dimensions of evaluating the metaphor of *viral sustainability* to describe the kind of
self-sustaining diffusion we’re after. It's worth unpacking this metaphor.  

*Viral* here is intended to capture the familiar self-sustaining diffusion of
fashions and fads. Friends and associates tell one another about what they're
up to and how it's going. Sometimes they try out what each other are doing then
keep doing it because it works for them. If this happens again and again over
time, and more people are *starting* to do something more frequently than people
are *stopping* doing it. The similarity of this process to the spread of
pathogens in epidemiology is exactly where the term *viral*, in the parlance of
our times, with apparently wide shared agreement about its meaning.
Viruses and other pathogens spread when people
interact, while also sometimes rapidly evolving to evade our efforts to stop
them. 

(LARGELY AI GENERATED BELOW TO MARGIN COLUMN NOTE, ALSO AI GENERATED)
In culture, virality is uneven and stochastic: some sparks
flare out, while others cascade unexpectedly. 
In philosophy, viral processes
blur agency—no one controls the spread, it emerges from many small acts. This
makes *viral sustainability* a natural metaphor for the pluralism of social
life: many hands, many voices, converging without central command into
collective action.  

But *viral* is only one register. Evolutionary biologists might call the same
thing *niche construction*: once behaviors spread, they reshape the ecological
and social environment in ways that feed back to support further spread.
Cultural theorists like Sperber would call the stable outcomes *cultural
attractors*: convergent points that diffusion tends to settle on, even through
noisy transmission. And systems theorists use *autopoiesis*—literally
“self-making”—to describe when a practice or institution doesn’t just persist
but actively reproduces the conditions of its own existence.  

These frames are not mutually exclusive and don’t need a strict mapping onto
stages of a diffusion curve. Instead, they’re complementary lenses. *Viral*
captures the ignition and pluralistic energy of spread; *niche construction* and
*attractors* highlight how environments and cognition stabilize practices;
*autopoiesis* emphasizes the long-term maintenance of systems that can
regenerate themselves. Together, they give us a richer intuition for what it
might mean for sustainable behaviors not only to diffuse but to take root and
endure.
