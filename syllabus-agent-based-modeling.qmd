# 2. *Agent-based Modeling* {.unnumbered}

*Winter 2026 (January 3 – March 24)*

This course teaches students how to **simulate human behavior and social learning** in order to predict the possible outcomes of interventions aimed at spreading sustainable practices. Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful computational technique that lets us explore **how individual-level decisions interact with social networks and ecological contexts** to produce collective outcomes.

The educational materials, the `socmod` R package, and any research we produce will always be **openly available**.

### Course Overview

In this course, we use **agent-based models** to explore how sustainable behaviors diffuse through modern, complex social systems. 
Agents represent individuals, each with specified psychological traits, social contexts, and behavioral tendencies, drawn from **psychology, sociology, evolutionary anthropology, and network science**. 

Students learn to **design, build, and analyze** ABMs, while strengthening their understanding of the behavioral and social sciences underpinning them.


### Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, you will:

- Construct agent-based models of **social learning and sustainability** using the R programming language  
- Simulate diffusion processes under varying **ecological, social, and uncertainty conditions**  
- Apply **network science** concepts to understand how structure shapes collective dynamics  
- Use **high-performance computing** techniques to run large-scale simulations  
- Analyze **large, complex datasets** generated by ABMs  
- Practice **open science workflows** using Git and GitHub
