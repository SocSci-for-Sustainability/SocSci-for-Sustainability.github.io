# Curriculum & Syllabi {.unnumbered}

This curriculum presents the courses of the **Social Science for Sustainability** program
currently offered by Matthew A Turner, PhD. The materials, including the
companion book, `socmod` library, and all lecture resources, are **open and
freely available online**. 

Courses in the curriculum share conceptual foundations including harnessing 
computational modeling, hands-on applications, and guided training for
developing, communicating, and writing quantitative social science research. 
Students develop highly transferable systems thinking skills; expertise in
social, cognitive, and network science; and programming proficiency in R using
*tidy* practices, which is in high demand especially for social scienctists.

The program offers courses on a quarterly schedule, which leverage the
persistent materials here. Courses are ten weeks of instruction in about twelve
weeks that include course kick-off and finishing and presenting final projects
if there are enough interested students.

Please **Subscribe** in the program to access the course lectures and other
synchronous material (click button below). This is also free. 
You will receive lecture schedule reminders and links for easy access later;
lecture previews and summaries; lecture scheduling
reminders; video shorts on technical topics; and 
opinions, news and reviews about research in social science and beyond.

### Courses {.unnumbered}

#### Introduction to Social Science for Sustainability
**Schedule:** Autumn 2025 (September 22 – December 20)  <span class="separator"></span>
[Syllabus](syllabus-introduction.qmd)


This introductory course weaves together strands from psychology, sociology, anthropology, and network science to understand **how different learning processes can promote or inhibit the diffusion of adaptations**. Through interactive lectures and computational exercises, students develop a foundation in modeling human behavior and social systems relevant to sustainability.


#### Agent-Based Modeling for Sustainability
**EBS 182 / EBS 282**  
**Schedule:** Winter 2026 (January 3 – March 24) <span class="separator"></span>
[Syllabus](syllabus-agent-based-modeling.qmd)

Developing sustainable societies requires understanding how sustainable practices spread through complex social networks. Students learn to **design, program, and analyze agent-based models** simulating the social transmission of sustainable behaviors under uncertainty. Skills include high-performance computing, data analysis of large simulation outputs, and dashboarding using R and Shiny.


#### Opinion Change: Modeling and Measurement
**Schedule:** Spring 2026 (March 30 – June 23)  <span class="separator"></span>
[Syllabus](syllabus-opinion-change.qmd)


Opinions shape collective outcomes, from climate policy to sustainable practices. This course explores **how social influence drives opinion dynamics**, covering models of extremism, polarization, and consensus formation. Students design simulations of interventions, analyze data, and produce publication-style final projects using the [`socmod`](https://css4s.github.io/socmod/) R library.


#### Summer Short Course (TBD)
**Schedule:** Summer 2026 (August 3 – September 9)  

A shorter, intensive offering designed to complement the main curriculum. Details forthcoming.


### Open Access & Independent Research {.unnumbered}

The educational materials we develop and the research we produce will **always
be openly available to the community**. Subscribing supports the delivery of
this curriculum *and* the development of tools, datasets, and modeling frameworks that enable **independent scientific research**.
