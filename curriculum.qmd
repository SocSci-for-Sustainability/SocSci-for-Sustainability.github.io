# Courses {.unnumbered}

# [Introduction to Social Science for Sustainability](syllabus-introduction.qmd)
**Schedule:** Autumn 2025 (September 22 – December 20)  

This introductory course weaves together strands from psychology, sociology, anthropology, and network science to understand **how different learning processes can promote or inhibit the diffusion of adaptations**. Through interactive lectures and computational exercises, students develop a foundation in modeling human behavior and social systems relevant to sustainability.

# [Agent-Based Modeling for Sustainability](syllabus-agent-based-modeling.qmd)
**EBS 182 / EBS 282**  
**Schedule:** Winter 2026 (January 3 – March 24)  

Developing sustainable societies requires understanding how sustainable practices spread through complex social networks. Students learn to **design, program, and analyze agent-based models** simulating the social transmission of sustainable behaviors under uncertainty. Skills include high-performance computing, data analysis of large simulation outputs, and dashboarding using R and Shiny.

---

# [Opinion Change: Modeling and Measurement](syllabus-opinion-change.qmd)
**Schedule:** Spring 2026 (March 30 – June 23)  

Opinions shape collective outcomes, from climate policy to sustainable practices. This course explores **how social influence drives opinion dynamics**, covering models of extremism, polarization, and consensus formation. Students design simulations of interventions, analyze data, and produce publication-style final projects using the [`socmod`](https://css4s.github.io/socmod/) R library.

# Summer Short Course (TBD)
**Schedule:** Summer 2026 (August 3 – September 9)  

A shorter, intensive offering designed to complement the main curriculum. Details forthcoming.

# Open Access & Independent Research {.unnumbered}

The educational materials we develop and the research we produce will **always be openly available to the community**.  
Subscribing supports not only the delivery of this curriculum but also the development of tools, datasets, and modeling frameworks that enable **independent scientific research**.
