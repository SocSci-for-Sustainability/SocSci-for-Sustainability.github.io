    "text": "Welcome and preface\nThanks for your interest in this short course on Computational Social Science for Sustainability. Please note there is a Quarto worksheet that we will work through as part of the tutorial: css4s/IC2S2-Tutorial-Worksheet.\nBriefly about me, the instructor, my name is Matt Turner. I am a lecturer in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability in the department of Environmental Social Sciences. So far I have developed two courses for the department: Computational Social Science for Sustainability and Agent-based Modeling. This short course for IC2S2 is a sampling of material from the two.\nThe question of our age is whether people can join forces to collectively and meaningfully push history out of its current rut of rapid ecological collapse towards a sustainable future. Technological solutions to the climate and general ecological crisis are proliferating. But will enough people do them to matter? How can we design social interventions with confidence to promote sustainable practices to replace maladaptive behaviors that exhaust local resources?\nThe model framework I develop here can help, or so I believe and hope you agree. The following chapters explain the theoretical and modeling framework for modeling social behavior with applications to behavior diffusion, cooperation for natural resource conservation, norm inversion, and opinion change. I will frame social science theory and computational model development in terms of various problems in sustainability to demonstrate intended use and to introduce sustainability to newcomers.\nWe will see together through programming examples how to rigorously test different intervention strategies. We will effectively prototype these interventions as software simulations in a sort of “wind tunnel” like used to design cars to instead choose between different designs for convincing an initial group of people to, first, adopt a sustainable practice. The second, but equally important, goal of sustainability interventions is to induce a self-sustaining process of behavior diffusion, where one by one people learn a sustainable practice through social interaction over time.\nSincere thanks again for your time and attention.

    "text": "Prefatory notes\nThe structure of this framework emerged as I developed my course Computational Social Science for Sustainability, with the selection pressure of being digestible and useful for students in the sustainability school. In the course we present models of social behavior diffusion to understand how sustainable practices spread in different idealized social contexts.\nThis IC2S2 tutorial introduces a framework for models of social behavior to organize them based on their assumptions, structure, applications, and other details. This is meant to complement data-driven approaches such as data analysis to incentivize and optimize real-world sustainable behaviors such as coordinated charging.\nDeveloping theories of why some sustainable practices spread but others don’t is essential to promote sustainable adaptation to climate change and other pressing sustainability problems. Sustainability encompasses many dimensions of human life, which are thoroughly encapsulated in the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (aka SDGs). There are seventeen Sustainable Development Goals, which can address how to build strong Vibrant Institutions that protect Basic rights including sustainable access to resources. This requires Environmental and Ecological protection, especially climate action. Together I call this the Sustainability VIBE, which is the vibe we’re trying to promote.\nTheoretical modeling is a powerful way to predict how common contextual differences, such as the heterogeneity of social contacts in a population, will affect outcomes, so a general strategy can be chosen for an application of interest. In modern best-practices for social science, any collection of data-driven approaches are most useful when they utilize at least a common vocabulary or framework (Deffner et al. 2024).\nThis work provides a new framework to accommodate alternative mechanistic formulations of the cognitive and social factors that power social diffusion. I designed this framework and software to introduce newcomers to the field so they can fluently put social science to good use. It seemed no single resource existed to do this in a highly-transferable programming language like R. R, furthermore, has a wide, active, disciplined, diverse, and vibrant set of scientific developers who could collectively be called the tidyverse, led by Hadley Wickham and the Posit Developers who create the RStudio IDE. The socmod software being developed along with the conceptual framework is designed to fit tidily within this system.\n\n\n\n\nDeffner, Dominik, Natalia Fedorova, Jeffrey Andrews, and Richard McElreath. 2024. “Bridging theory and data: A computational workflow for cultural evolution.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 121 (48): 1–11. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2322887121.",

    "text": "1.1 Sustainability as Social Science’s (Ethical) “Manhattan Project”\nIndigenous, local peoples of the South Pacific Islands and other coastal habitats have sustainably managed mangrove forests to dissipate storm surges and prevent erosion, mitigating potential costs of climate change since long before the anthropocene (Alongi 2002; Nalau et al. 2018; Pearson, McNamara, and Nunn 2020; McNamara et al. 2020). First peoples of western North America have similarly practiced prescribed burns to prevent destructive wildfires during times of drought for millennia (Eisenberg et al. 2019; Kolden 2019). Despite their long-known effectiveness, adaptive practices like these often fail to spread widely. Instead, international development agencies frequently advocate for the construction of seawalls, for example, even though seawalls can exacerbate flooding once breached and incur high maintenance costs (Piggott-McKellar et al. 2020). Inland forest management is beset by polarization among stakeholders (Swette, Huntsinger, and Lambin 2023), resulting in devastating wildfires burning a buildup of fuels or greenhouse gas-intensive clearcuts.\nHere we introduce what we dub the puzzle of diffusion: why do some effective, sustainable practices like mangrove forest management fail to diffuse broadly, while other less effective or even maladaptive practices become widespread (Figure 1.1)? To answer this, we answer some more basic questions along the way. First, how do people decide what to do, i.e., how does learning work? Second, what is the effect of identity on how well or how likely we are to learn from people of the same or different identity? Third, what is the effect of social structure, i.e., who knows whom, represented as a social network? Agent-based models are useful because they provide a framework for creating rigorous, mechanistic, concrete models of social diffusion of adaptations. They help us deal with the complexity of causation in the real world through strategic selection of causal input variables and model details, which, over several model time steps, lead to social emergent phenomena like the diffusion of climate change adaptations.\nThe focus of this course is developing agent-based models that can help us simplify complex combinations of cognitive and social factors to represent only the most relevant ones, and observe the effect of these on simulated outcomes such as the proportion of people adopting adaptive behaviors, or opinion extremism and polarization.\nThe agent-based modeling approach developed in this course provides a structured way to test the effectiveness of social interventions aimed at promoting sustainable behavior. An intervention is some structured introduction of a sustainable practice through education or other means with the intention of sparking the endogenous diffusion of the practice after direct instruction has ended. For example, Airoldi and Christakis (2024) developed a public health intervention to improve health outcomes for residents of villages in rural Ecuador far from hospitals. Airoldi and Christakis educated residents over an extended period of time about hand washing and warning signs of pregnancy complications, then surveyed residents to see if those not involved in the initial intervention had learned the information from the intervention. Airoldi and Christakis’s study was designed to test a hypothesis about whether the friendship-nomination strategy for forming the seed set of individuals selected for direct instruction from the intervention.\nBy formalizing and testing our assumptions about social dynamics, agent-based modeling supports better design and evaluation of policies and programs aimed at driving real-world change. This deductive, experimental approach allows us to explore how cooperation, coordination, identity, homophily, and influence affect the likelihood that beneficial behaviors will spread. In the coming chapters and associated problem sets we will analyze social learning of behaviors and social influence of opinions in various contexts. This could save serious resources. We could use computational models to test the hypothesis from Airoldi and Christakis (2024) that friendship nominated seed sets indeed better sparked endogenous diffusion in many different social networks with different group structures, which would give us a more comprehensive understanding of when friendship nomination does well or not.\nThe goal is to build up a repertoire of agent-based modeling techniques for incorporating different assumptions about how social learning or influence work, whether group structure is important to these processes, and for modeling social network structure. This repertoire can then be applied to sustainability contexts of interest to understand how different sustainability intervention strategies, such as who should learn about sustainable adaptations first in an educational intervention or how best to assist stakeholder deliberations to reduce opinion polarization that can derail collective adaptation. To choose model components wisely requires an understanding of elements of sustainability, cognitive and social science, network science, and software engineering.\nThe UN Sustainable Development Goals help us focus and organize our work by providing concrete goals for evaluating progress towards sustainable development for all Figure 1.2. These goals include targets for institutional development that promotes basic conditions for human thriving (justice, equality, education, public health, and no poverty) so as to assemble and enable a critical mass of people to participate bringing about sustainable development. People cannot participate in sustainability if they suffer in poverty, from illness, or subjugation by authoritarians–all but the most zealous environmental defenders will fight on when these basic needs are unmet. Since progress has been slower than necessary.\nSustainability, then, has several different dimensions, all of which contribute to climate action and environmental protection. I have organized these goals into the VIBE system to guide sustainability promotion where Vibrant Institutions meet the Basic needs, including Environmental and Ecological protection. The 17 goals and how they each help catch a VIBE are illustrated in Figure 1.2.\nOrganizing and connecting our work to has two benefits. First, it helps us identify which cognitive and social factors are at work in different sustainability foci. Second, it expands the corpus of existing research on which we draw to consolidate our social and cognitive theories of behavior change that we will apply to sustainability interventions. While many of us in computational social science know our work is important as basic science partly because we are confident it can apply to real-world problems, it is not clear how. Part of this problem seems to stem from the lack of a clear goal for this science beyond evaluating alternative theories of social behavior.\nSustainability serves as a sort of never-ending Manhattan Project for social scientists, an ethically praiseworthy pursuit that will provide a selection pressure on social science frameworks or theories that theory-comparison goals cannot: our social science frameworks, theories, and models should be maximally useful to the long-term study of sustainability. That means simulations should be designed so the model parameters and outcome measures are observable and could reasonably be measured in the real-world. It means flexibly adopting different assumptions in different cases, possibly sampling from different theories that, in a different context, might make contrary predictions. In the next",

    "section": "1.2 Computational social science (for sustainability)",
    "text": "1.2 Computational social science (for sustainability)\nSocial science is immensely broad and complex comprised of numerous traditional academic disciplines in their entirety, such as anthropology and sociology, with contributions from several other traditional disciplines, including cognitive science, engineering, and physics. We use the problem of promoting sustainable practices via interventions to structure this work. Sustainability interventions are eductaion campaigns to induce the diffusion of certain adaptive, sustainable behaviors, such as in public health (Airoldi and Christakis 2024), microfinance to support gender equality at work, home, and everywhere (O’Connor and Weatherall 2018; Clydesdale2023?), and climate change adaptation via ecosystem protection (Brooks et al. 2018; McNamara et al. 2020). Following the UN SDGs, we see that this is quite a broad range of potential behaviors, which is actually a good thing. It means that our conclusions could apply to a broad range of application domains.\nOn reflection, social science for sustainability needs a science of how adaptive, sustainable behaviors, opinions, and other socially-transmitted items diffuse from person to person, throughout a population, over time. I don’t know for sure, but it seems like this may be the fundamental problem in social science, broadly understood. The puzzle of adaptation frames the overarching question of designing interventions: how best to jump-start a self-sustaining process diffusing adaptive sustainable behaviors?\nComputational social science is the use of mathematics and computers to understand and model the mechanisms underlying social diffusion phenomena, such as the adoption of sustainable practices or rising political extremism, and statistically analyze collective behavior data. We start here and for the first chapters of the book developing formal and generative models of promoting widespread behavior change. When we come to opinion change, we arrive at a natural transition point where theory necessarily meets practice to understand how to properly measure opinion change in the real world, which requires statistical inference since opinions are not directly measurable. We apply our techniques to show that\nComputational social science is a cognitive gadget to help us use social science theory for reasoning about the effect of different cognitive capacities (e.g., adaptive social learning), social processes (e.g., rising extremism), and social and natural environment constraints (e.g., social networks, wildfire risk). Too often in the history of social science, social science theory is not presented mathematically, with squishy verbal explanations of theories and their consequences instead of concrete, rigorous mathematical or computational statements, where rigorous means they are theoretically true under a set of explicitly-specified assumptions. This means that mechanisms have tended to be only vaguely specified, and changes in assumptions cannot be quantitatively, let alone systematically, explored (Turner and Smaldino 2022).",

    "section": "1.3 Social diffusion of sustainable practices",
    "text": "1.3 Social diffusion of sustainable practices\nHere we sketch a general theoretical framework that avoids the gridlock of deciding which social science theory is best by starting at one level of abstraction higher than we typically use for social science. The level we start at here sits above theories like complex contagion of behaviors, cultural evolution, or opinion dynamics models of opinion change, which can be taken as occupying a more implementation level of abstraction. Here we begin by examining the most general features of social interaction and behavior diffusion, filling out details with assumptions drawn from the more implementation-level social science theories.\nIn these models we assume there are two possible behaviors, or classes of behaviors, that individuals can do. These are called the Adaptive behavior or practice, or behavior \\(A\\) for short. The non-adaptive or maladaptive behavior is the Legacy behavior, i.e., the business-as-usual behavior. An individual who does the adaptive behavior is an \\(A\\)-doer, and one doing the legacy behavior is an \\(L\\)-doer.\nTo represent interventions, we initialize agent populations with one behavior or the other, specify environmental or ecological conditions such as the apparent benefit of different behaviors, and set agent learning strategies. Learning strategies that we consider are contagion (probabilistic adoption on exposure), success-biased learning (successful individuals are more likely to be chosen as teachers), and conformity or frequency-biased learning (more prevalent behaviors are more likely to be adopted).\nThe model represents time in steps. On each time step, agents select partners, interact, and update behaviors based on outcomes and learning rules. These steps are repeated until specific conditions or thresholds are met. Stopping conditions are typically specified as when a maximum time step is reached, when the entire population fixates (i.e., all do the same) on one behavior or the other. After the model stops, the dynamics can be inspected or the outcomes can be aggregated across simulations in the case of agent-based modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Agent-based modeling simulation cycle.\n\n\n\n\n1.3.1 Formal models of diffusion\nIn the next chapter I explain how to develop various formal models of behavior diffusion that represent changes in prevalence of different behaviors.\n\n\n1.3.2 Agent-based models of diffusion\nAgent-based models (ABMs) provide a structured way to explore complex systems by simulating interactions between autonomous agents, i.e., simulated people. In sustainability contexts, ABMs offer a low-cost testbed for understanding how interventions might impact social dynamics and environmental outcomes. For example, Airoldi and Christakis (2024) demonstrated through regression analysis across that one method for selecting individuals targeted in a public health education campaign worked better than another. They studied over 20,000 individuals across Honduran villages of about 100 people each to reach their findings. Real-world verification of the efficacy of different intervention strategies is important. However, we can also use agent-based models to represent the diffusion of information in simulated populations where interactions are structured by model social networks. We can initialize thousands or millions of simulated villages in which this information could diffuse with different intervention strategies, and observe the distribution of the adoption of sustainable behaviors for each potential intervention strategy. We can then analyze which performed best in silico, which can be helpful if interventions will be taken to different contexts. In other worlds, we can use ABMs to deduce how different learning rules, group identities, and social structures shape sustainability outcomes generally, which can guide our selection of real-world intervention strategies.\nWe will analyze and draw on several real-world empirical studies of interventions to develop our agent-based models that we in turn will use to simulate interventions in order to deduce which strategies are most effective for social interventions to promote sustainability, and why. A social intervention (or just intervention) for promoting sustainability is any concerted effort where those promoting a sustainable practice introduces information about how to perform that practice to a population. Deductive methods complement regression-based inferential or inductive strategies. Deductive strategies can explain which strategies are most effective and why in idealized, cost-free settings (cost-free at least compared to the cost of real-world social interventions at scale).\nLow-cost experimentation with simulated social interventions to promote sustainability are critical. Unless progress is accelerated towards we can expect to “have 575 million people living in extreme poverty, 600 million people facing hunger, and 84 million children and young people out of school. Humanity will overshoot the Paris climate agreement’s 1.5°C ‘safe’ guardrail on…temperature rise. And, at the current rate, it will take 300 years to attain gender equality” (Malekpour et al. 2023, 250). Accelerated transformations are required to reach goals necessary to avoid increasingly frequent and costly climate change disasters (United Nations 2023). It is not plausible to do real-world experiments at the global scale required to infer which strategies work best in which situations.\nIn this course we will focus on deducing how between different cognitive and social factors, or other initial conditions, affect simulated sustainability intervention outcomes. We will frame our studies in terms of sustainable development goals, but we will never fit our models to observations. Nonetheless, we will strive to develop models that are amenable to real-world interventions against which the models could be fit and predictions could be compared. It seems this is not done too much in practice yet in sustainability. However, some of our colleagues focused on studying basic processes that underlie cultural transmission do exactly this to explain experimental data and archaeological observations (Deffner et al. 2024), which thereby improves their theory, models, and understanding of cultural evolution in a theory-model-observation cycle. With more time and research effort, this cycle may become commonplace in sustainability.\nThe urgent need to understand how sustainable behaviors spread in order to develop effective interventions pressures social scientists to make social science more rigorous, reliable, and digestible by non-social scientists. In the rest of this Introduction we review cognitive and social theories of social learning, identity and influence, homophily and core-periphery network structures, and preview the remainder of the course material.

    "section": "1.4 Social learning strategies",
    "text": "1.4 Social learning strategies\nHuman kind is set apart by powerful learning and reasoning capabilities (Witt et al. 2024) that enable cultural transmission and accumulation of technologies and practices no other species matches (Henrich 2015). For our sustainability models, we only need simple models of cognition and learning. It would never be practical to do psychological or cognitive tests in the context of sustainability interventions that targets large populations, for one thing, so we could never compare detailed cognitive assumptions or predictions with reality. For our purposes we will consider three general classes of learning strategy:\n\nSuccess-biased learning: Individuals are more likely to adopt behaviors perceived to be successful or beneficial.\nFrequency-biased learning: Individuals adopt behaviors because others are already doing them, creating a conformity effect.\nContagion: Individuals copy behaviors simply by observing others performing them.\n\nIn the mangrove versus seawall example, success-biased learning might favor seawalls if influential external actors, who seem successful or wealthy, advocate for them, even if seawalls are ultimately less effective. Mangrove forests might become widely adopted if, on the other hand, frequency-biased learning predominates and many communities have adopted that method.\n\n1.4.1 Social learning models with example\nTo make this more concrete, we formalize (i.e., give formulas for) these three learning strategies as follows using the example in Figure 1.4. In the example, there is one focal agent who is the one doing the observing/learning, labelled with the ID 1, and three social network neighbors with IDs 2, 3, and 4. The focal agent is deciding whether or not to install residential solar. One of his neighbors has installed it, 2. Based on 1’s perception, 2 is the wealthiest, represented by four dollar symbols. 3 is perceived to have one dollar and 4 has two dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Agent 1, the focal agent, is considering whether to install residential solar. The probability agent 1 installs residential solar depends on its social learning strategy.\n\n\n\n\nSuccess-biased learning\nIn success-biased learning, learners first choose an interaction partner/teacher randomly weighted by observed fitness of their neighbors, which is a generic term for wealth, power, status, etc. In general for this case, the probability that learner \\(i\\) chooses teacher \\(j\\) is\n\\[\n\\Pr(i \\text{ chooses } j) = \\frac{f_j}{\\sum_{k \\in n_i} f_k}.\n\\]\nThe probability that \\(i\\) adopts \\(A\\) is then the sum of the probabilities of choosing each neighbor performing \\(A\\) (contained in the set \\(m_i\\)),\n\\[\n\\Pr(i \\text{ adopts } A) = \\frac{\\sum_{j \\in m_i} f_j}{\\sum_{k \\in n_i} f_k}.\n\\]\nIn our example, only one neighbor installed residential solar with a fitness (i.e. wealth in this example) of 4, while the others have finess 1 and 2. Therefore, \\(\\Pr(1 \\text{ adopts } A) = \\frac{4}{7}\\).\n\n\nFrequency-biased learning\nIn frequency-biased learning there is no interaction partner or teacher chosen. The probability of adoption is only given by the relative frequency of each behavior. The general expression is\n\\[\n\\Pr(i \\text{ adopts } A) = \\frac{|m_i|}{|n_i|}.\n\\]\nIn our example, then, the probability of installing residential solar under frequency-biased learning is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n\nContagion learning\nIn the contagion learning model, the focal agent’s (i.e., the learner’s) teacher (i.e., interaction partner) is chosen at random. Then, the learner adopts the teacher’s behavior with probability \\(\\alpha\\), the adoption rate. In this case, then, the probability that 1 adopts residential solar is\n\\[\n\\Pr(1 \\text{ adopts solar}) = \\alpha \\Pr(1 \\text{ selects 2 as teacher}) = \\alpha \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\nMore generally, for focal agent \\(i\\) with the set of neighbors \\(n_i\\) (\\(n_1 = \\{2, 3, 4\\}\\) in the example), where \\(m_i\\) is the set of neighbors who have adopted the adaptive behavior (\\(m_i = \\{2\\}\\) in the example). We call the adaptive behavior \\(A\\). The general probability of adoption in contagion learning is therefore\n\\[\n\\Pr(i \\text{ adopts } A) = \\frac{\\alpha |m_i|}{|n_i|},\n\\]\nwhere the \\(| \\cdot |\\) operator counts the number of elements in a set.\n\n\nCombinations of learning models\nThere is no reason different learning models cannot be combined. The software we will use in this class, socmod, provides flexibility to the user to define their own learning models. The simplest combination of the three learning models above is to add an adoption rate to either frequency- or success-biased learning. In this approach, one could call the behavior selected by the models above could be considered prospective or candidate behavior to learn, then is actually learned with probability \\(\\alpha\\).\nFor another potentially useful modification, \\(\\alpha\\) could be defined at the individual level, say \\(\\alpha_i\\), or for dyads (i.e., a pair of interacting individuals) , \\(\\alpha_{ij}\\), where \\(i\\) is still the focal agent learner, but we have added \\(j\\), representing the selected teacher.",

    "section": "1.5 Identity and Influence",
    "text": "1.5 Identity and Influence\nGroup identity critically influences social learning. Neuroscience research demonstrates that our brains distinctly respond to individuals identified as part of our group (Cikara and Van Bavel 2014), as revealed through fMRI neural imaging (Figure 1.5). This ability likely evolved because when humans first emerged about two million years ago, it was much more important for survival to be able to rapidly identify whether someone was a friend or foe based on group markers. Although group membership can affect how we respond to information learned from others, group membership itself is quite plastic, meaning who belongs to which group can be rapidly reconfigured. For example, neural signals of race-based group perception was observed to be suppressed and overridden when individuals were in mixed-race groups created by experimenters that competed against other mixed-race groups in an psychological experimental task (Van Bavel, Packer, and Cunningham 2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Figure 1 reorganized with original caption from Cikara and Van Bavel (2014)\n\n\n\nStudies further show that group identity can strongly influence behavioral choices. For instance, experimental evidence reveals people resist adopting beneficial behaviors if associated with opposing political identities (Ehret et al. 2022), emphasizing how identity can create substantial barriers to sustainability. This general effect of group membership interfering with learning is called outgroup aversion (Smaldino et al. 2017).\n\n1.5.1 Social networks, homophily, and core-periphery structure\nSocial structure can significantly impact behavioral diffusion, especially in core-periphery configurations. Core-periphery networks emerge as a response to risk and uncertainty, e.g., in food sharing networks (Ready and Power 2018), so they are hypothesized to also be important in climate change adaptation transmission networks (Jones, Ready, and Pisor 2021). Core-periphery networks can be created by setting appropriate group sizes and homophily levels in homophily network models (Turner et al. 2023) or specifying certain connectivity probabilities to the stochastic block matrix algorithm for creating structured random graphs (Rombach et al. 2014; Milzman and Moser 2023). Homophily is the measure of how much more likely an individual is to socially connect within their own group versus with a member of a different group. Homophily can range from -1 to +1, where -1 represents no within-group connections and only between-group connections (i.e., anti-homophily); 0 represents an equal probability of within- and between-group connections, and +1 represents only within-group connections. We will define homophily as either a global or group-level variable, though homophily could vary individually as well. There are two types of homophily:\n\nChoice Homophily: Individuals actively prefer interacting with similar others.\nInduced Homophily: Social interactions limited by historical or external conditions like geography, profession, birthplace, etc.\n\nThese structural elements can significantly limit the diffusion of sustainable practices from peripheries, like the mangrove management on smaller islands, to central cores. However, as colleagues and I have showed, this core-periphery structure, defined by moderately high majority-group homophily can actually promote the diffusion of adaptations, provided the adaptation is practiced by the minority group (Turner et al. 2023), as is the case for mangrove forest management or prescribed burns.\nDue to time restrictions we will not be able to analyze the effects of social networks in this tutorial.",

    "section": "1.6 Computational techniques for agent-based modeling",
    "text": "1.6 Computational techniques for agent-based modeling\nThis section introduces agent-based modeling in socmod starting with basic functional and object-oriented programming in R. It therefore builds on an assumed knowledge of R basics which can be gained by studying, for example, Hands-On Programming with R or other basic R tutorial introductions.\nTo model social behavior it helps to have intuitive software tools grounded in an empirically-motivated, self-consistent scientific theory. socmod provides those tools, but to put it to best use it’s helpful to know how it works, especially for people used to using R in a data science context. Many of the same tools are transferable, especially declarative/functional programming, as is used and encouraged by the tidy approach in R for Data Science.\nTo create simulations that generate social behavior we have to go beyond tabular representations of the world to more complex representations of people and their interactions that can be measured. These measurements are recorded in a standard tabular format, e.g., CSV, which can then be analyzed using tidy/R for Data Science strategies.\nIn agent-based modeling, we create software representations of simulated people, i.e. agents, or other interacting entities, including the agents’ environment. Object-oriented programming is the natural choice for software design in this case because it provides a structure for defining custom objects like socially interacting agents. An object is one bit of data that could be a number or character type, but could also be something more complicated. In object-oriented programming we define custom classes that specify various data fields and function methods for maintaining and modifying the state of objects. The fields and methods of a class therefore are sets of related data and functions to represent things in the world.\nTo summarize, objects are a way to track and modify the state of different software entities. We can create simulations of real-world systems by defining custom object types called classes whose state and behaviors are modeled on relevant real-world features and behaviors.\nIn socmod, we define custom R objects for agent-based models of social behavior using the R6Class method that creates a new object type, i.e., a new class. We use tidy-style functional programming where helpful to represent model features and dynamics.\nIn the remainder of this chapter, I will first review variable assignment and data structures in R including vectors, lists, data.frames, and tibbles. We then review relevant topics in functional programming, then demonstrate how to create custom classes in R with the library R6. This tutorial then closes with a demonstration of a simple four-agent agent-based model of social behavior, kept simple to highlight the functional and object-oriented design patterns in socmod, representing Agent, an AgentBasedModel, and Trialclasses defined using the R6Class function.\n\n1.6.1 Data collection types in R\nIn R, there is a hierarchy of data collection types that are necessary to know about for functional programming, which often involves applying a function across every element of a collection of data. Data collections include vectors, lists, data.frames, and tibbles, which we’ll cover here.\n\nCollections of basic data types\nIn computer science, a collection is an abstract data type that organizes and stores instances of other data types. In R, the most basic data types are numbers (e.g., double or integer) and text, whose data type is character in R whether it’s a single character or several:\n\nprint(typeof('c'))\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\nprint(typeof(\"social science is kewl\"))\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\nVectors\nR vectors are defined using the c() function, e.g., vec &lt;- c(0, 0, 1). The data type of all vector elements must be the same. This is enforced by R coercing data to different types, for example:\n\nprint(c(0, 0, 1))\n\n[1] 0 0 1\n\nprint(c(0, 0, \"yo\"))\n\n[1] \"0\"  \"0\"  \"yo\"\n\n\nWe index vectors using single square brackets, with R indexing starting from 1:\n\nvec &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # equiv to vec &lt;- 1:5 or seq(1, 5)\nprint(vec[1])\n\n[1] 1\n\nprint(vec[length(vec)])\n\n[1] 5\n\n\n\n\nLists\nIf one wants to keep elements of different types in a single collection, use the R list:\n\nl &lt;- list(0, 542, \"yo\")\nprint(l)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 0\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 542\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"yo\"\n\n\nNote the visual representation has changed on printout. We now need to use double-square brackets to index list elements themselves:\n\nprint(l[[3]])\n\n[1] \"yo\"\n\n\nIf we leave off one of the square brackets we effectively get a sub-list with just one element:\n\nprint(l[3])\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"yo\"\n\n\nThis is useful if you want to create a new sub-list with more than one element:\n\nprint(l[c(2, 3)])\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 542\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"yo\"\n\n\n\n\nNamed lists\nNamed lists are the primary key-value store in R, just like dict in Python. It allows us to label entries of the list and access them using double square brackets with the character name or using the $ access operator:\n\nnamed_l &lt;- list(a = c(0, 5, 6), b = c(7, 8, 9))\nprint(named_l$a == named_l[[\"a\"]]) # compares element-by-element\n\n[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE\n\nprint(all(named_l$b == named_l[[\"b\"]]))\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\ntibble (and data.frame)\nBoth the tibble and data.frame classes represent tabular data, meaning data that can be represented in table format, e.g., in comma- or tab-separated value format. There are some subtle differences listed below, but we’ll use tibble for representing our tables.\nTibbles are like fancy lists that have special properties that make data manipulation more efficient. The details of how this works aren’t super important at this point. The important thing to know is how one can initialize tibbles and access tibble columns similarly to lists, as shown in the following example:\n\ntbl &lt;- tibble::tibble(a = c(0, 5, 6), b = c(7, 8, 9))\nprint(tbl$a)\n\n[1] 0 5 6\n\nprint(tbl[[\"b\"]])\n\n[1] 7 8 9\n\n\nUsing tibbles ensures that data manipulation and analysis using the tidyverse will work as expected. For example, the tidyverse provides functions for analyzing different groups of data within a larger dataset. This is a common data analysis pattern called split-apply-combine, which in the tidyverse translates to group-by and summarise when using the dplyr library. For example, we can calculate the mean of measurements in “experimental” and “control” conditions in some fake data:\n\nobservations &lt;- tibble::tibble(\n  condition = c(\"experimental\", \"experimental\", \"control\", \"control\"),\n  measurement = c(13.5, 14.6, 3.4, 5.4)\n)\n\nmean_measurement_tbl &lt;- \n  observations %&gt;% \n  dplyr::group_by(condition) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::summarise(mean_measurement = mean(measurement))\n\nprint(mean_measurement_tbl)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  condition    mean_measurement\n  &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 control                   4.4\n2 experimental             14.0\n\n\n\n\nDifference between data.frame and tibble\nThe tibble library provides a table data representation (also called tibble) that is a bit more flexible and intuitive than the R built-in data.frame. One reason I prefer tibbles is because traditional data.frames automatically convert strings to factors unless you tell them not to. Tibbles don’t, so you’re never surprised.\nColumn naming is also more flexible with tibbles. A data.frame requires syntactically valid R names, while tibbles can handle column names that include spaces or even non-standard characters. I often use this feature to use column names like Mean adaptation success that print nicely when used as labels in ggplot.\nFinally, tibble operations always return a tibble. For example, if df were a data.frame, the operation df[, 1] would return a vector by default. If it were a tibble it would return another tibble, making behavior more predictable in data analysis pipelines.\n\n\n\n1.6.2 Functional programming\nFunctional programming is especially useful for writing code that applies the same function to several inputs, but wants to leave it up to the user to specify exactly which function should be applied. In socmod we pass functions as arguments to other functions to specify how agents pick their interaction partners (i.e., teachers in a learning context) and how social learning works. Here are some simple examples demonstrating the key concepts and techniques of functional programming that could help with socmod programming.\n\nHigher-order functions: functions with function arguments\nIn R, and other programming languages supporting the functional style, one can treat functions like any other data and pass it as an argument to other functions. A function that accepts a function as an argument is called a higher-order function. Here is a simple example of a higher order function that takes some data as a first argument and applies the function f to that data twice, putting the result of each calculation in a two-element vector.\n\nrepeat_2_higher_order_func &lt;- function(data, f) {\n  return (c(f(data), f(data)))\n}\n\nBelow we call this higher order function by providing data=2 as the first argument and an anonymous function as the second argument, which can be written using \\(arg) { ...function body... } syntax:\n\n# \\(x) {...} is equivalent to function(x) { ... }; these are \n# anonymous functions.\n# Expecting to return c(4, 4)\nrepeat_2_higher_order_func(data = 2, f = \\(x) { return (x * 2) }) \n\n[1] 4 4\n\n\nThe above is the representation of a vector printed to screen, so we see that our expectations were matched.\n\nc(4, 4)\n\n[1] 4 4\n\n\n\n\nmap: a common, useful higher-order function used often in socmod\nOne of the most useful and common higher-order functions is the map function. This function maps a function, denoted .f below, onto every element in a collection, denoted .x. This notation is from the map family of functions in the purrr library for tidy functional programming.\n\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nHere is an example of mapping an anonymous function that multiplies its input by 3 onto a vector with entries 2 and 8:\n\n# Now get we use map_vec that applies .f to every element of .x,\n# expecting the following to return a vector with elements 3*2 \n# and 3*8, i.e., c(6, 24).\npurrr::map_vec(.x = c(2, 8), .f = \\(x) { return(3 * x)})\n\n[1]  6 24\n\n\nIf we want to apply a function that takes two variables, the value and index of an element in a collection, we can use the imap family of functions as follows to return a vector that contains the original element multiplied by its place in the input vector:\n\ninput_vec &lt;- c(2, 5050, 6)\npurrr::imap_vec(input_vec, \\(el, idx) { return (idx * el) })\n\n[1]     2 10100    18\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6.3 Custom objects: R6 classes in socmod\nClasses are ways to encapsulate diverse distinct, but related, processes, behaviors, data, attributes, and other types of information in a single object, i.e., a software representation of an instance of that entity. R6 is a library for creating our own custom classes that serve as an abstract template that specifies what distinguishes different types of objects/entities. Below we show first how to create a new agent, i.e., a new instance of the Agent class that is provided by socmod. After that is a fun example of how we can design a different social behavioral model, one of football/soccer matches. We write classes for players and teams and develop a play_match(team1, team2) function that pits two teams against each other.\n\nThe Agent class in socmod\nBelow we create a new instance of the Agent class using the class constructor, the function written socmod::Agent$new() below that creates a new instance of the class.\n\na1 &lt;- socmod::Agent$new(1, name = \"Matt\", \n                        behavior = \"Adaptive\", \n                        fitness=1e6)\n\nWe can use the access operator, $ in R, to access the fields (i.e., attributes) of agent a1 like so:\n\nprint(a1$get_fitness())\n\n[1] 1e+06\n\nprint(a1$get_name())\n\n[1] \"Matt\"\n\nprint(a1$get_id())\n\n[1] 1\n\nprint(a1$get_behavior())\n\n[1] \"Adaptive\"\n\n\nWe can also use purrr::map functions over neighbors like so:\n\n# Assign neighbors to a1.\n\na1$set_neighbors(c(\n  socmod::Agent$new(id = 2, name = \"n2\"),\n  socmod::Agent$new(id = 3, name = \"n3\")\n))\n\n# Get the list of neighbors back to check it worked.\nneighbors &lt;- a1$get_neighbors()\nprint(class(neighbors))  # should be [1] \"Neighbors\" \"R6\"\n\n[1] \"Neighbors\" \"R6\"       \n\n# Neighbors$map() returns a list...\nneighbor_names &lt;- neighbors$map(\\(n) n$get_name())\nprint(neighbor_names)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"n2\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"n3\"\n\n# ...use `unlist` to convert it to a vector:\nprint(unlist(neighbor_names))\n\n[1] \"n2\" \"n3\"\n\n\n\n\nExercise: design and define classes from scratch\nIn class we started creating our model of a soccer player agent called Footballer, defined below. We ran out of time at the end of class to write methods for Footballer, i.e., ways that a football player could interact with the world, or that the world could act upon a soccer player. However we only had time to create a stub for two methods. A stub is a minimal chunk of code that does very little to nothing, but doesn’t get in the way by causing errors or anything like that. It enables us to document our plans for future development in the exact place where it would happen in the code.\nBelow we have stubs for score_goal and get_penalty methods for in-game behaviors. Other possibilities could include get_traded that would change its team and perhaps get_signed for cases where a player is a free agent.\n\nlibrary(R6)\n\nFootballer &lt;- R6Class(\"Footballer\",\n                        \n  public = list(\n    # Listing attributes as fields and \n    # setting to zero for their definition.\n    speed = 0.0,  # units of max km/h\n    accuracy = 0.0, # probability of scoring on a shot\n    market_value = 0.0, # \n    aggressiveness = 0.0, # units of penalties per match\n    team = \"\",\n    \n    initialize = function(speed = 15, \n                          accuracy = 0.2, market_value = 1e6, \n                          aggressiveness = 0.5, \n                          team = \"Free agent\") {\n      self$speed = speed\n      self$accuracy = accuracy\n      self$market_value = market_value\n      self$aggressiveness = aggressiveness\n      self$team = team\n    },\n    \n    # Stub two SoccerPlayer class methods...\n    # ...one for scoring a goal in a game...\n    scored_goal = function() {\n      return (ifelse(runif(1) &lt; self$accuracy, 1, 0))\n    },\n    # ...and one for getting a penalty in a game.\n    get_penalty_on_play = function() {\n      return (runif(1) &lt; self$aggressiveness)\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nTeam &lt;- R6Class(\"Team\",\n                \n  public = list(\n    name = \"\",\n    players = list(),\n    wins = 0,\n    ties = 0,\n    payroll = 0,\n    games_played = 0,\n    \n    # Team name is required, with players optionally specified.\n    initialize = function(name, players = list()) {\n\n      self$name = name\n\n      # Initialize players and payroll.\n      for (player in players) {\n        self$payroll &lt;- self$payroll + player$market_value\n        player$team &lt;- name\n      }\n\n      self$players &lt;- players\n    },\n    \n    # Add a player to the roster.\n    sign_player = function(player) {\n      # Add the player to the team.\n      self$players &lt;- c(players, player)\n      # Update payroll.\n      self$payroll &lt;- self$payroll + player$market_value\n      # Update the player's team to be this team's name.\n      player$team &lt;- self$name\n    }\n  )\n)\n\n\nfootballer &lt;- Footballer$new(accuracy = 0.5)\nfootballer$scored_goal()\n\n[1] 0\n\n# sum(purrr::map_vec(1:10, \\(.) p$scored_goal()))\n\nWe can define a function that simulates playing a football match where the team that scores more goals wins, or a tie if teams have the same score. We track penalties received but assume they don’t have an effect on the match outcome. We assume each player gets ten chances to score a goal. We leave it to the reader as an exercise to make use of the Footballer$get_penalty_on_play() method within the game to add penalties and consequences in the game (e.g., penalty kicks or something), and to use the Team$sign_player() add more players to each roster, which should increase the mean total scores in each game based on the simple way we’ve modeled gameplay in play_match.\n\n# Define a function that models a football match.\nplay_match &lt;- function(team1, team2) {\n  \n  # Walk over each player to see how many scores they get, \n  # summing to get the total team score. \n  team1_score &lt;- sum(\n    purrr::map_vec(\n      team1$players,\n      \\(player) {\n      # Calculate the total goals scored by the current player.\n        sum(purrr::map_vec(1:10, \\(.) player$scored_goal()))\n      }\n    ) \n  )\n  \n  team2_score &lt;- sum(\n    purrr::map_vec(\n      team2$players,\n      \\(player) {\n      # Calculate the total goals scored by the current player.\n        sum(purrr::map_vec(1:10, \\(.) player$scored_goal()))\n      }\n    ) \n  )\n  \n  if (team1_score == team2_score) {\n    team1$ties &lt;- team1$ties + 1\n    team2$ties &lt;- team2$ties + 1\n    cat(\"Tie game!\\n\")\n  } else if (team1_score &gt; team2_score) {\n    cat(team1$name, \"wins!!!\\n\")\n    team1$wins &lt;- team1$wins + 1\n  } else {\n    cat(team2$name, \"wins!!!\\n\")\n    team2$wins &lt;- team2$wins + 1\n  }\n  \n  cat(team1$name, \": \", team1_score, \"   \",  \n      team2$name, \": \", team2_score, \"\\n\")\n  \n  team1$games_played &lt;- team1$games_played + 1\n  team2$games_played &lt;- team2$games_played + 1\n}\n\nFirst we need teams, which we create and to which we assign players using the constructor, Team$new() in the code below.\n\n# Initialize two teams, Whales and Squirrels, each with two\n# players.

Understanding whether an operation creates a new copy or modifies an object in place (called mutation) is important because it affects whether you need to assign the result back to a variable or not. Even though this idea is usually taught in more advanced programming, it’s useful for beginners working with modeling and simulation because different parts of R (like data frames vs. agent-based models) follow different rules, and knowing which is which can help avoid confusing bugs.\n\n1. The underlying tension: how R handles object copying and modification\nAt the heart of R’s behavior lies a subtle technical distinction: whether an object is copied or modified in place when you change it. By default, R uses copy-on-modify semantics, meaning that if you change an object, R creates a new copy behind the scenes and leaves the original unchanged. This protects your data from unintended side effects and reflects R’s origins as a functional programming language for statistics. But as R evolved to support more object-oriented programming and to interface with other languages like C and C++, it introduced types of objects—such as environments, external pointers, and R6 classes—that instead use reference semantics. With these objects, changes happen directly to the object itself without making a copy. Internally, R’s i nterpreter keeps track of when it needs to copy or reuse memory, but these mechanics aren’t always visible, which can lead to surprises when working with more complex objects.\n\n\n2. A practical guide for navigating copy and reference semantics\nFor most core R data types—vectors, lists, data frames—you can assume that R makes a copy whenever you modify an object. But for certain kinds of objects, especially environments, R6 classes (used in socmod), and graphs from the igraph package, the behavior is different: these follow reference semantics, meaning they’re modified directly. In socmod, all models and agents are implemented using R6 classes, so when you call something like model$set_parameter(\"n_agents\", 100), the model’s state is updated directly and immediately—no need to reassign model &lt;- .... This makes working with simulations feel more natural, but it also means that habits from working with regular R objects don’t fully apply. A simple rule of thumb: if it’s an R6 object or a special object like an igraph graph, expect it to behave by reference; otherwise, expect copy-on-modify.\n\n\n3. How igraph fits in: working with C-backed graphs in R\nMuch of igraph isn’t written in R itself, but in another programming language called C. C allows developers to write code that’s much faster and more efficient than what’s possible in R alone. This efficiency is great for users—igraph can handle large networks quickly—but it also introduces a subtle complication to how we work with graphs in R. When you modify an igraph object, you’re actually asking C code to change the graph behind the scenes. But instead of directly changing the graph you already have, igraph’s functions usually return a new graph object with the changes applied. This means that even though igraph mostly follows reference semantics (where an object can be updated without copying everything), you still need to explicitly reassign the result of a modification to keep the updated graph. It’s different from how socmod’s models and agents work: those are built with R6 classes, which really do modify objects “in place” without needing reassignment.\n\n\n\n1.6.5 Agent-based models of social behavior\nHere we develop our first agent-based models of social behavior. We’ll start small, with the following four-household network of solar panel electrification using only success-biased learning (Figure 1.6). Then we’ll do a detailed comparison of different social learning strategies with different parameterizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Example social network and sustainable adaptation diffusion problem.\n\n\n\nIn the example, agent 2 has adopted rooftop solar. It has some adaptive fitness, which can be thought of as the financial gain from adopting a sustainable, adaptive behavior. We can directly create the social network using igraph::make_graph() then set it as the model’s social network, along with setting the learning strategy to be contagion learning.\nThe adoption_rate parameter specifies how likely another agent is to adopt the adaptive behavior when exposed to it. The drop_rate is how likely an agent doing the adaptive behavior is to stop doing it and revert to the non-adaptive behavior.\n\nExample 1: Time series of adaptation diffusion\n\nadoption_rate = 0.8\n \n# Run model with \ng &lt;- igraph::make_graph(~ 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 3-2)\nmps &lt;- make_model_parameters(\n  contagion_learning_strategy, graph = g, adoption_rate = 0.8, drop_rate = 0.1\n)\ncabm &lt;- make_abm(mps); \ncabm$get_agent(2)$set_behavior(\"Adaptive\"); \ntrial &lt;- run_trial(cabm, stop = fixated)\nplot_prevalence(trial, tracked_behaviors = c(\"Adaptive\", \"Legacy\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Same, but now call the adaptive behavior \"Baglowie\" instead of \"Adaptive\".\ng &lt;- igraph::make_graph(~ 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 3-2)\nmps &lt;- make_model_parameters(\n  contagion_learning_strategy, graph = g, adoption_rate = 0.8, drop_rate = 0.1\n)\n\ncabm &lt;- make_abm(mps)\ncabm$get_agent(2)$set_behavior(\"Baglowie\"); \n\ntrial &lt;- run_trial(cabm, stop = fixated, adaptive_behavior = \"Baglowie\")\nplot_prevalence(trial, tracked_behaviors = c(\"Legacy\", \"Baglowie\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAiroldi, Edoardo M., and Nicholas A.

    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nSocial science can help promote the broad diffusion of sustainable practices including public health, socio-economic equality, climate action, and strong institutions. Conformity is theorized as a social learning strategy in which individuals preferentially adopt behaviors that are more common. Conformity is widely believed to be a “substantial”, if not the primary, driver of human cultural adaptation. Some have recognized that, logically, conformity cannot possibly spark and maintain the diffusion of initially rare adaptations. The full consequences of this are not well understood, however. Here we develop a mechanistic model to compare the strength of adaptation diffusion under conformist and success-biased learning. Success-biased learning uses the success of prospective teachers as a heuristic to choose from whom to learn. It stands in for the suite of uniquely powerful human learning capacities beyond conformity. We prove that success-biased learning always provides stronger evolutionary selection signals and greater success promoting widespread diffusion. Conformity, then, at most could help consolidate already-popular adaptations. Encouraging conformity is a risky strategy, however, since it could reduce openness to novel sustainable practices in general. Sustainability, therefore, will never be promoted by conformity alone. Educational campaigns on the benefits of sustainable practices would be more effective and humane.\nConformity is hypothesized to explain cultural evolutionary, demographic, and political outcomes in humans (Henrich and Boyd 1998; Boyd and Richerson 2005; Richerson and Boyd 2005; Morgan, Suchow, and Griffiths 2020). Conformity has also been recognized as perhaps not the only social learning mechanism that could support human cultural adaptation over time (Borofsky and Feldman 2022), and could possibly cause population collapse under environmental variability (Whitehead and Richerson 2009). Still, conformist transmission seems to be understood as primary, possibly augmented by additional social cues (Gervais 2021), but likely would be undermined by “biased transformation” by more sophisticated cognitive processes (Morgan, Suchow, and Griffiths 2020). Conformity has been identified experimentally as a critical process, but its “strength” seems to depend on the adaptive value, i.e., the difference in benefit between an adaptation and an alternative behavior that could replace the adaptation. Conformity has been reported in bird (Aplin et al. 2015) and . The resulting sigmoidal adoption curves, representing increasing prevalence of an adaptation over time when the adaptation diffuses, is taken as decisive evidence of conformist transmission (Smaldino, Aplin, and Farine 2018), despite critiques of this approach (Acerbi et al. 2016).\nWe seek to show conclusively that conformity alone cannot initiate and promote the diffusion of adaptive, sustainable practices. We do this by demonstrating that conformity is vanishingly weak at diffusion onset, entering the entrenchment stage where the prevalence approaches half the population, and entrenchment onset when . Some of these facts are already acknowledged, that conformity cannot trigger the onset of endogenous diffusion of a rare adaptation, and has been thus patched with anti-conformity, which is preferring behaviors practiced by less than half of the population (Kaleda Krebs Denton et al. 2020). Furthermore, we know that conformity can undo innovations towards more ergonomic, advantageous adaptations (Morgan, Suchow, and Griffiths 2020), which are just the sort of sustainable practice that is most likely to be transmitted. Anti-conformity has been suggested as a means to promote rare adaptations to spark diffusion onset, however it is unclear how anti-conformity could be switched off to allow adaptations to diffuse throughout the population past the 50% prevalence mark (Kaleda K. Denton, Liberman, and Feldman 2021). Similarly, once the adaptation is practiced by just more than half of the population, with the adaptation on its way to entrenchment where it is practiced by a large majority of the population, should be relatively weak since it is difficult for individuals to sense the true prevalence of different behaviors.\nI formalize these arguments using prevalence dynamic, an abstraction of social learning derived from the standard replicator dynamic that can flexibly represent a range of social learning strategies. This framework can be operationalized as difference or differential equations, stochastic dynamical equations in the Kiumura-Crow-Gillepsie tradition, or agent-based models. We use all three approaches to compare the strength of conformity and success-biased learning, where success-biased learning stands in for a range of adaptive learning mechanisms that use reliable cues other than the adaptation prevalence.\nI demonstrate that at diffusion onset, when few individuals know a behavior, there is no value of anti-conformity or conformity that can match the strength of selection for success-biased learning. At diffusion entrenchment, when the prevalence goes from less than to greater than half the population, anti-conformity can only weakly get prevalence to 1/2, and conformity can only weakly propel prevalence away from 1/2. Success-biased learning provides stronger selective signals in all three cases. Similarly, finite MCMC calculations of the adaptation success rate\nThese logical and dynamical problems warrant a revision of the current conformity-centric approach to cultural evolution. These results suggest that success-biased learning should be the focus for interventions to promote sustainable practices, for example, due to the weakness of conformity during critical periods of diffusion. Theoretically, this casts some doubt on the idea that conformity would be selected for when more powerful social learning methods are available, as well as a robust cognitive system for integrating various informational channels and mental computations (Witt et al. 2024).\nWhat originally appeared as modeling patches for artefacts of conformist transmission may in fact be deep theoretical problems with current, vague operationalizations of conformist transmission. This work suggests that current operationalizations of conformity may be illogical, in a technical sense. This cannot be handwaved away. Interestingly enough, it seems conformist tendencies in social science itself to have gotten us to this point where theories and models have proliferated under the common banner of “conformity” but their ontological relationship to one another is uncertain. Even if conformity were a major driver of cultural evolution, it is currently impossible to rigorously and thoroughly evaluate different models and theories of conformity, let alone compare conformity effects with other social learning strategies (Kendal et al. 2018).",

    "text": "2.1.1 Overview\nIn the remainder of this paper, we operationalize conformity and success-biased learning strategies in terms of the prevalence dynamics. We use a formal differential equation analysis to analyze the relative strength of selection for conformist and success-biased transmission at diffusion onset, when the adaptation is rare, at entrenchment, when the adaptation prevalence passes half the population, and fixation, when the adaptation is adopted by everyone. We then calculate fixation probabilities for different conformity strengths at each of these points in the diffusion for different conformity strengths and learning strategies. Finally, we analyze the dynamics of simulated diffusion in an agent-based social behavior model.\nIn the next section we introduce the Model formalism: the differential equation formulation, the stochastic fixation probability model, the agent-based model, and our general analytical strategy. Next, we will demonstrate in the Analysis that in many cases, conformity transmission is significantly weaker than success-biased learning, though still could contribute to adaptation if it could be properly controlled and calibrated. We close with our Discussion of why, all together, adaptation diffusion cannot be due to conformity alone.",

    "text": "2.2 Model\nTo evaluate the strength of conformity compared to success-biased learning, we first specify steps in the learning process as a mechanistic verbal explanation that we represent in a block-and-arrow diagram Figure 2.1. The diagrammatic model describes behavior diffusion as transitions from doing an unsustainable, maladaptive behavior to doing a sustainable, adaptive behavior Figure 2.2. We label the unsustainable, maladaptive, business-as-usual behavior to be the legacy behavior, or just \\(L\\). One who does \\(L\\) is an \\(L\\)-doer. The sustainable behavior is the \\(Adaptive\\) behavior, or just \\(A\\). One who does \\(A\\) is an \\(A\\)-doer. The prevalence of \\(A\\) is \\(a \\in [0, 1]\\). The prevalence of \\(L\\) is just the complement of \\(a\\), i.e., \\(1 - a\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Block and arrow diagram of the conceptual model underlying the different analytical approaches used here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Transition types in diffusion of adaptive behaviors.\n\n\n\nThese transitions drive differential “reproduction” in the cultural evolutionary process. There are three relevant transitions: (1) individuals adopt a behavior an Adaptive behavior, which we call behavior \\(A\\). We assume there is only one alternative behavior, the Legacy behavior which we label \\(L\\). An \\(A\\)-doer is one who has adopted, or does, the \\(A\\) behavior. Similarly an \\(L\\)-doer does the legacy behavior. The prevalence of \\(A\\) is \\(a\\), and the prevalence of \\(L\\) is then the complement, \\((1-a)\\). We prefer the more compact notation \\(\\dot a\\) for the rate of change of \\(a\\).\nAs part of this model of behavior diffusion, we name four stages of the diffusion process in which we evaluate the strength of selection with conformity or success-biased learning Figure 2.3. First, diffusion onset, where there are few \\(A\\)-doers so \\(a &lt;&lt; 1\\). After the adaptation has spread so that \\(a &lt;&lt; 1\\) is no longer valid there is the Entrenchment transition where the prevalence crosses half the population, i.e., from a minority of the population adopting \\(A\\) to a majority adopting. There are two parts to Entrenchment, the Entrenchment Approach stage, where the prevalence is approaching \\(a = 0.5\\), and the Entrenchment Onset stage, where prevalence begins increasing from \\(a = 0.5\\). The final stage is Fixation, where the behavior is reaching eveyrone in the population, i.e., \\(a \\to 1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Behavioral diffusion stages in which we evaluate strength of selection.\n\n\n\nWe then formulate a differential equation of the model that we call the prevalence dynamic. We obtain the prevalence dynamic by rewriting the evolutionary replicator dynamic in terms of behavior transitions. Behavior diffusion is an evolutionary process since one behavior out of a set of options will be learned by more people than others, i.e., it is spread through differential replication/reproduction. We use the prevalence dynamic version of the replicator dynamic because replication or reproduction are oblique metaphors for social learning. We are interested in changes in the prevalence of behaviors, not their reproduction, per se, in social diffusion. Implicitly, the replicator/prevalence dynamics assume a well-mixed population, which means every agent is equally likely to partner with any other. The population is also assumed to be so large that it is effectively infinite, but nonetheless individuals reliably sample according to the specified learning rules without error.\nNext, we develop a stochastic prevalence dynamic in a Kimura-Crow style model that accounts for randomness in social interactions in finite populations. This enables us to calculate the probability of fixation of the adaptive behavior, i.e., the probability that all individuals adopt the adaptive behavior via social diffusion. This can be used to show that conformity (or anti-conformity) alone can sometimes result in fixation, but success-biased learning more frequently leads to adaptation fixation.\nFinally, we develop an agent-based model to evaluate our formal conclusions both about dynamics and success rates for different initial prevalence values. This enables us to get a more grounded understanding of how stochasticity and drift affect dynamics and outcomes.\n\n2.2.1 Prevalence Dynamic\nThe prevalence dynamic expresses change in prevalence in terms of transition probabilities representing the chance that the learning process causes one \\(L\\)-doer to swtich to be an \\(A\\)-doer, and vice-versa. The transition probability of \\(L \\to A\\) is \\(P(A|L)\\). The transition probability of \\(A \\to L\\) is \\(P(L|A)\\). We will derive the prevalence dynamic from the replicator dynamic.\nThe replicator dynamic is \\[\n\\dot a= \\frac{a}{\\bar w}(w_A - \\bar w).\n\\tag{2.1}\\] If we multiply through we get \\[\n\\dot a= \\frac{a w_A}{\\bar w} - a.\n\\] Note that \\(w_A / \\bar w\\) is the per-capita “reproduction rate” of behavior \\(A\\) when \\(A\\) competes with \\(L\\) for prevalence, where \\(\\bar w = a w_A + (1 - a) w_L\\). Therefore, \\(\\frac{a w_A}{\\bar w}\\) is the total prevalence of \\(A\\) on the next time step. It is equivalently the probability that any one individual will adopt or keep \\(A\\) on the next time step. We write this \\(P(A)\\), and obtain our prevalence dynamic, \\[\n\\dot a= P(i \\text{ does } A \\text{ at } t + dt) - a,\n\\]\nWhere \\(i\\) could be any individual in the population. Defining \\(p_A = P(i \\text{ does } A \\text{ at } t + dt)\\), we have \\[\n\\dot a= p_A - a.\n\\tag{2.2}\\] This makes sense: the change in prevalence is the prevalence for the next time step minus the current prevalence.\n\nConformity Prevalence Dynamic\nWe can use Equation 2.2 directly to write down the conformity prevalence dynamic. In conformity, at each time step individuals adopt a new behavior based on the rule that says more prevalent behaviors are more likely to be adopted compared to less prevalent ones. In that case we have \\[\nP(A; \\kappa) \\propto a^{\\kappa}\n\\] where \\(\\kappa\\) is a measure of the conformity strength. We’ll set \\(\\kappa\\) in a moment, but first we need to normalize this proportional term. Before that, note \\[\nP(L; \\kappa) \\propto (1-a)^\\kappa.\n\\] Note that \\(P(A) + P(L) = 1\\), and so we must normalize by each proportionality and we get \\[\nP(A) = \\frac{a^\\kappa}{a^\\kappa + (1-a)^\\kappa} - a.\n\\]\nNeutral selection (neither anti-conformity or conformity) occurs when \\(\\kappa = 1\\), since \\[\n\\dot a= \\frac{a}{a + 1 - a} - a = 0\n\\] for any \\(a\\) when \\(\\kappa = 1\\). For a more natural value for conformity, let \\(\\kappa = 1 + \\gamma\\), so \\(\\gamma = 0\\) is the neutral point instead. Then we get anti-conformity when \\(\\gamma &lt; 0\\), conformity when \\(\\gamma &gt; 0\\), and neutral selection with null dynamics when \\(\\gamma = 0\\). With this definition, the full conformity prevalence dynamic is \\[\n\\dot a= \\frac{a^{1 + \\gamma}}{a^{1 + \\gamma} + (1-a)^{1 + \\gamma}} - a.\n\\tag{2.3}\\]\n\n\nSuccess-biased Prevalence Dynamic\nSuccess biased learning specifies that the probability of adopting the adaptive behavior is proportional to the both the fitness of the behavior and the prevalence of \\(A\\)-doers who can act as teachers/demonstrators for \\(L\\)-doers. Therefore we write \\[\nP(A) \\propto a f_A\n\\] Again since \\(P(A) + P(L) = 1\\), and \\(P(L) \\propto (1 - a)f_L\\), then the normalization constant for \\(P(A)\\) is the sum of the two proportional terms, so\n\\[\nP(A) = \\frac{a f_A}{af_A + (1-a)f_L}.\n\\] The denominator is actually the mean fitness, so we define \\(\\bar f = af_A + (1-a)f_L\\) and we obtain \\[\n\\dot a= \\frac{af_A}{\\bar f} - a = \\frac{a}{\\bar f}(f_A - \\bar f).\n\\] When we use success-biased learning we obtain the replicator equation but with fitness replacing reproduction rate! Oftentimes this is assumed instead of derived without derivation, based on a circular definition of “fitness” as being measured in terms of reproduction rates.\nTo simplify things, we can set the baseline legacy fitness to be \\(f_L = 1\\) without loss of generality and set \\(f_A = 1 + s\\), so that \\(s\\) represents the selection pressure towards adopting \\(A\\). Then we have \\[\n\\bar f = a(1 + s) + (1 - a) = 1 + as.\n\\] Then the prevalence dynamic becomes \\[\n\\dot a= \\frac{a(1-a)s}{1 + as}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n2.2.2 How to compare different learning processes\nOne problem with comparing different theoretical learning processes is that they use different parameterizations that are difficult to match to real-world situations, much less be compared to one another. To deal with this problem, we use a pair of mathematical procedures to understand how the strength of selection relate to one another, independent of the exact parameterizations. These procedures are common in both dynamical systems and evolutionary theory to achieve exactly this sort of goal: understand in a parameter-agnostic way how variables change with respect to one another in a rigorously qualitative way. I explain further below how this works. If it is still not clear after that explanation, it will hopefully become clear when it is applied to our case of interest. The first procedure is to focus\nThe limiting cases we focus on here are defined in terms of the prevalence, \\(a\\), approaching or being slightly greater than some reference value. Our reference values are related to the onset, entrenchment, and fixation ontology of behavior diffusion Figure 2.3. The first limiting case is when \\(a &lt;&lt; 1\\), or equivalently \\(a \\approx 0\\). In evolutionary theory this is called invasion analysis, but we break for onset analysis in the interest of a more exact, less insular phrase for behavior diffusion and to develop a more humane ontology than what we’ve inherited from behavioral and social science terminology developed in the context of the Red Scare and the Cold War, motivated by a glut of defense department funding. The second limiting case is when \\(a \\to 0.5^-\\), read as a goes to 0.5 from below, i.e., from less than 0.5 to 0.5. This will let us compare the strength of conformity and success-biased learning in entrenchment , a critical period where social momentum can be the difference between successful and failed adaptation diffusion. The entrenchment onset is similarly important, when \\(a = 0.5 + \\epsilon\\) and \\(\\epsilon \\to 0\\), read “epsilon goes to 0”. This procedure allows us to compare the strength of selection at the critical point when just more than half of the population does \\(A\\), and successful diffusion is in sight. Finally, when \\(a\\) approaches 1, this is the fixation phase.\nOnce the limiting case is identified, we can obtain simplified forms of the prevalence dynamic by removing terms in the dynamic that are small enough to be ignored. In some cases we can do this directly. For example, \\(1 - a \\approx 1\\) when \\(a\\) is small. For instance, if \\(a=0.05\\), then \\(1 - a = 0.95\\), yielding an error in the approximation of 5%. In other cases, we can harness a more advanced tool from calculus, the Taylor expansion, that can be used to approximate differentiable functions, meaning their derivatives are defined and finite for any input value to the function.\n\nTaylor expansion\nThe Taylor expansion represents a function, call it \\(f(x)\\), as an infinite sum…\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Fixation probability\n\n\n2.2.4 Agent-based model\nAgent-based models enable the transparent specification of individual-level attributes and interaction structure. We will develop an agent-based model of behavior diffusion based on . confirm results from the two formal analyses of diffusion rate \\(\\dot a(a_0)\\) and the success rate \\(\\sigma(a_0)\\).",

    "text": "3.1 Cooperation as a correlative coordination problem\nIn California’s Central Valley, farms, orchards, dairies, and other agricultural industries use disproportionately more water than the communities where farm workers live in an increasingly precarious state. Wells increasingly run dry when they aren’t contaminated by deadly chemicals first. The state-level water restriction enforcement agency has recently rejected several plans proposed by local water district planners. All this currently occurs against a backdrop of climate variability and political instability that increasingly drives the migration of farmers and farm workers alike (see CA Central Valley water annotated references and links below). This problem is increasingly acute across diverse societies and aquifers, though in some cases groundwater is being restored to previously overdrawn aquifers (Jasechko et al. 2024).\nEquitable access to clean potable water depends on cooperation among those sharing groundwater aquifers, consistent with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to Reduce Inequalities (SDG 10) and to provide Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 6), representing Group I and Group B goals to, in general, support infrastructure/institutions and basic human needs, respectively. Cooperation to sustain groundwater resources is increasingly important since there are more frequent climate change-driven droughts threatening human and non-human life on land. This project, then, also addresses Group E (environmental and ecological protection) Sustainable Development Goals, namely to accelerate relevant Climate Action (SDG 13), and to protect the literal bedrock of ecosystems that support all Life on Land (SDG 15).\nTheoretically, we know that high rates of migration can disrupt the formation of cooperative communities in idealized models of the establishment and diffusion of cooperation to effectively form collectives. However, many theoretical questions remain and existing results have not yet been interpreted for how they could support sustainability in any way, including groundwater sustainability. We therefore develop here a spatial agent-based model of cooperation where agents represent water consumers arranged on a spatial grid. Migration is represented as a random switch of two agents in the grid. Cooperation or its opposite, defection, result in different payoffs depending on which of these two behaviors interaction partners choose. Cooperation can be mutually beneficial, but it comes at the cost of an initial investment that will be uncompensated if a model interaction partner defects. If both individuals defect, i.e., choose to not cooperate, then they may face a disaster debit, i.e., a penalty that could represent, e.g., ecological collapse, external sanctions, or some other form of penalty.\nWe analyze how migration can break up cooperatives, i.e., blocks of cooperating agents who assort to effectively block out those who intend to defect. We characterize the effect of migration rate for a range of costs of cooperation. This basic analysis lays the groundwork for designing interventions that help maintain cooperation even with frequent migration (see Exercise 3).\nCooperation is a correlative coordination problem, meaning that payoffs are maximized when individuals do the same behavior as others. Cooperation dilemmas, in evolutionary game theory on which we draw here, are defined to entail the risk of betrayal, where defectors are those in society who reap the benefit of costly contributions of others, but not contributing anything themselves. The more general correlative coordination problems do not necessarily entail risk of betrayal in the same sense. For example, deciding which side of the street to drive on: it doesn’t matter which side, so long as everyone does that. There is no immediate “cost” to driving on the agreed-to side of the road, only benefit that you’ll be sure to avoid crashing head-on with others, so long as they correlate their behavior with yours, i.e., with some societal norm.\nIt is costly to cooperate with groundwater pumping limits from the point of view of agricultural producers. For example, less water input might mean lower almond yield and fewer profits in the short term. If enough other orchards defect, this could lead to dry wells, and it would prove to have been unwise to cooperate since defectors made the most money while it lasted, multiplied in effect if defectors evaded accountability for their behavior.",

    "text": "3.1.1 Cultural evolutionary game theory\nUnder success-biased learning, culture can be said to evolve. A behavior is like a phenotype, and knowledge of or capacity for a behavior is like genes or alleles that encode a phenotype. Fitness in either case is the benefit received from the phenotype expression.\nTo study how the prevalence of cooperation varies over time and as \\(t \\to \\infty\\), we assume each agent does one of two behaviors: Cooperate or Defect. In our approach here and in many cases, it is unnecessary to represent knowledge of how to cooperate itself, including the acquisition of this knowledge. In other words, doing a behavior implies having already learned how to do it. This strategic abstraction is called the phenotypic gambit, with “gambit” really meaning something more like “assumption”.\n\n\n3.1.2 Inspiration behind this article\nOne of the goals of this article is to demonstrate socmod use by analyzing a game theory model of cooperation between agents on a spatial grid. The other goal is to motivate the study with a real-world sustainability problem, groundwater conservation. The model and analysis is inspired by Ch. 6 in Paul Smaldino’s book Modeling Social Behavior, including some of the exercises below that Paul includes in his analysis: Paul’s model is written in NetLogo, with analysis and visualizations done in R, it appears. See Paul’s book for how alternative assumptions enable the formal, mathematical analysis of cooperation prevalence in different spatial contexts with migration, as opposed to simulated/generative as done here.",

Agents are located at grid points in a rectangular 2D lattice, though we use a square lattice with \\(L=21\\) agents per side in our analysis here. Agents play a cooperation game, known as the prisoner’s dilemma game, a common game theory representation of cooperation where a focal agent gets a benefit \\(b \\in [0, \\infty)\\) if their interaction partner cooperates, but the focal agent pays a cost \\(-c\\) if they choose to cooperate, where \\(c\\in[0, \\infty)\\). The payoffs from combinations of the four possible combinations of (Cooperate/Defect) x (Cooperate/Defect) for the dyad define the game’s payoff matrix (Table 3.1).\n\n3.2.1 Spatial structure\nSpatial structure, we hypothesize, provides the substrate for cooperation to take hold since neighbors can form spatially organized cooperatives, i.e., clusters of contiguous, connected cooperators. We represent spatial structure by locating agent nodes in a two-dimensional lattice graph we set to be square with side length \\(L\\), so the agent population size is \\(N = L^2\\). The model grid can be rectangular in general, and it is left as an exercise to the reader to test what happens when \\(N\\) is held constant but the aspect ratio of the grid is varied, i.e., the width divided by the height.\nFirst consider a grid with \\(L=6\\) agents per side, so \\(N=36\\) population size.\n\nsource(\"R/cooperation/model.R\")\n\nL = 6\n\nplot_example_adoptnet &lt;- function(abm, layout = igraph::on_grid()) {\n  plot_network_adoption(\n    abm, \n    layout = layout,\n    behaviors = c(\"Cooperate\", \"Defect\"), \n    behavior_colors = c(\"#0486C1\", \"#D38855\")\n  )\n}\n\n# Using defaults coop_benefit = 1.0 and coop_cost = 0.2\nabm &lt;- make_cooperation_model(grid_width = L, grid_height = L)\nplot_example_adoptnet(abm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can make a rectangle with the same number of agents like so\n\nabm &lt;- make_cooperation_model(grid_width = 9, grid_height = 4)\nplot_example_adoptnet(abm, layout = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Social interaction and payoffs\nAgents interact with all of their neighbors on each time step, collecting payoffs according to whether an agent and each neighbor is currently doing the “Cooperate” or “Defect” behavior, or equivalently whether each agent is a cooperator or defector.\n\n# Have the focal_agent play the coordination game with all neighbors\nplay_game_with_neighbors &lt;- function(focal_agent, model) {\n  # Focal agent plays game with neighbors, accumulating payoffs\n  total_payoff &lt;- \n    sum(unlist(\n      # Use the Neighbors$map function to play with all neighbors\n      focal_agent$get_neighbors()$map(\n        \\(n) play_game(focal_agent, n, model)\n      )\n    ))\n  # Focal agent's fitness gets set to the total_payoff\n  focal_agent$fitness_current &lt;- total_payoff\n}\n\nThey receive payoffs resulting from play_game, which are given in Table 3.1 in terms of the benefit to cooperation, \\(\\beta\\), the cost of cooperation, \\(\\gamma\\), and the disaster debit \\(-\\delta\\), where \\(\\beta,\\gamma,\\delta \\in [0, \\infty)\\). For our initial study here we will set \\(\\delta = 0\\), leaving an examination of how cooperation prevalence is affected for different values of \\(\\delta &gt; 0\\) as an exercise.\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Payoff matrix in dyadic interactions to focal agent, \\(i\\), whose behavior is read across rows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocal \\(\\downarrow\\quad\\quad\\) Partner \\(\\rightarrow\\)\n\\(b_j = \\text{Cooperate}\\)\n\\(b_j = \\text{Defect}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(b_i = \\text{Cooperate}\\)\n\\(\\beta - \\gamma\\)\n\\(-\\gamma\\)\n\n\n\\(b_i = \\text{Defect}\\)\n\\(\\beta\\)\n\\(-\\delta\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe play_game function is defined as follows:\n\n# Two individuals play game with one another; b = coop_benefit, c = coop_cost\nplay_game &lt;- function(focal_agent, partner_agent, model) {\n  return (\n    model$payoff_matrix[\n      focal_agent$behavior_current,\n      partner_agent$behavior_current\n    ]\n  )\n}\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Selection for cooperation via social learning\nWe implement success-biased learning here in a custom model_step function called coop_model_step used as the sole defining function for the LearningStrategy I call coop_game_strategy. coop_game_strategy uses NULL functions for partner_selection, since agents interact with all neighbors, and also for interaction, since agents accumulate payoffs over all interactions with neighbors. Both of these are implemented in the coop_model_step function that defines this learning strategy’s model_step named constructor parameter (full definition of coop_model_step is given in the Appendix).\n\n# For this normal game in this format we don't have individual partner selection \n# and interaction steps.

Specifically we first vary the cost of cooperation, \\(\\gamma\\), setting the migration rate \\(\\mu = 0.0\\), and observe the results. Second, we vary \\(\\mu\\), setting \\(\\gamma = 0.2\\), and observe the results.\n\n\n3.2.5 Model parameters\nThe model parameters specify how agent learning and migration behavior work. They also set the size of the grid, which indirectly sets the number of agents. We systematically vary two of these, \\(\\gamma\\) and \\(\\mu\\), and observe the dynamics and outcomes to implement our computational experiments.\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Model parameter descriptions and settings.

    "text": "3.3 Analysis\nTo understand how the perceived risk or cost of cooperation and the mutation rate each affect the emergence of cooperation, we examined how cooperation cost and migration rate separately affect the emergence and maintenance of cooperation in simulated populations. We confirmed computationally that at or beyond critical cooperation cost, \\(\\gamma_c = \\beta / 4\\), stable cooperatives cannot form, the defect behavior fixates, and cooperation goes extinct (Figure 3.1 A). A similar analysis of a minimal five-agent “cross” or “plus” cooperative is unstable if \\(2\\beta &gt; 4\\beta - 4\\gamma\\), i.e., if \\(\\gamma &gt; \\beta / 2\\) (Figure 3.1 B). This explains why we observe such a sharp transition from widespread cooperation to zero cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Defector-turns-cooperator and cooperator-turns defector conditions in the founding and destruction of cooperatives. Three cooperators in a line will result in new cooperators adjacent to the middle node of the triad if the cost of cooperation is less one quarter of the cooperation benefit, i.e., \\(\\gamma &lt; \\gamma_c = \\beta / 4\\) (A). A five-agent “cross” cooperative is unstable if the cost of cooperation is greater than half of the benefit: \\(\\gamma &gt; \\beta / 2\\).\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1 When does cost of cooperation become prohibitive?\nWe see that cooperation emerges at various non-zero equilibrium values for cooperation costs up to 0.25, including up to 0.249 (Figure 3.3)! In our initial conditions with half of the agents starting as cooperators, the prevalence of cooperators decreases initially as the relatively isolated cooperators become defectors (Figure 3.2). Then more and more agents join nascent cooperatives, so the prevalence eventually begins to increase again. When cooperation cost is 0, the dip is lowest, and cooperatives begin to grow and expand cooperator prevalence to their maximum values earlier on compared to greater cooperation costs with \\(\\gamma &lt; \\beta / 4\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Dynamics of cooperator prevalence as a function of cooperation cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Dynamics of cooperator prevalence as a function of cooperation cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 When does migration undermine cooperation?\nMigration, as hypothesized, can undermine cooperation. Based on our reasoning to explain why cooperation is only supported up to \\(\\gamma = 0.25\\), we see that for cooperators to spread, there must be at least three lined up to seed a cooperative that grows into a cluster of cooperators. For this particular choice of parameters, cooperatives can reliably grow only when the migration rate is less than 0.125 (Figure 3.5), but there is high variability in the cooperator prevalence as \\(\\mu\\) approaches 0.125, indicating that the cooperatives are unstable (Figure 3.4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Cooperator prevalence dynamics as a function of migration rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Cooperator prevalence at \\(t=50\\) over migration rate.

    "text": "3.4 Discussion\nWe found that there exist critical cooperation cost/risk values that, when exceeded, cause cooperation to collapse. If we intend to use these models to promote climate action via sustainable adaptations, then this guides us to focus on (1) the perceived cost or risk of cooperation to farmers and municipalities; and (2) the induced migration patterns induced by climate change and other risk factor in the California groundwater case.\nThis model made several strategic assumptions to make it tractable to analyze, however these were selected at the exclusion of other factors. See the Exercises below for a review of some details we left out and a guide to exploring alternative assumptions on your own.\n\nCultural evolution in agriculture (Waring work) and how cooperatives form (Waring, Goff, and Smaldino 2017). Social behavior science-inspired field work for ecosystem protection Bujold, Williamson, and Thulin (2020).\n(broader implications) This indicates we should be focusing groundwater recharge on the areas with the most amenable geological qualities for replenishing the groundwater aquifers (Stanford Doerr news brief summarizing Rosemary Knight’s research, “Scientists map fastest pathways for replenishing Central Valley groundwater”)\n\nWhen space structures interactions, large cooperatives can emerge starting from a few pioneer cooperators. The emergence of cooperatives requires that (1) cooperation be cheap, and (2) cooperators remain in cooperatives sufficiently for a sufficiently long time. Our idealized model of space, social interaction, and migration rigorously proved these theoretical claims to be correct. This modeling approach serves as a template for future work with more serious applications. See the Exercises for some ideas on how to extend the model to include ecological disaster penalties when two cooperators interact, and how to represent different size grids with loose connections, creating a sort of small-world network using rewiring.",

    "text": "3.5 Exercises\n\nExercise 1: Disastrous defection\nHow do you think adding a defection disaster penalty, \\(\\delta &gt; 0\\), will affect the prevalence of cooperation in simulations? Develop a computational experiment to investigate how cooperation prevalence is affected for different values of \\(\\delta &gt; 0\\). Hint: use run_trials, specifying, e.g., disaster_debit = c(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0), then summarise over disaster_debit in summarise_dynamics or summarise_outcomes and plot, e.g., the mean prevalence at time \\(t=200\\), or whatever is appropriate.\nDo larger values of \\(\\delta\\) make cooperation more common? If so, how great must \\(\\delta\\) be in order to maintain no-migration cooperation levels for a given migration frequency?\n\n\nExercise 2: The shape of cooperation\n\nCreate a new computational experiment with this model where you hold \\(N\\) constant but vary the aspect ratio of the grid. For example, if we use 1024 agents we can have a square grid, aspect ratio 1, if we use \\(W=H=\\) where \\(W\\) is width and \\(H\\) is height. We can generate several other aspect ratios, as shown in the screenshot below. Approximately the same number of agents also works, for example, a 10x6 or 11x6 rectangle has approximately the same number of agents as 8x8 = 64.\nThis spatial grid has hard/non-periodic boundaries, i.e., agents at the edge have only three neighbors, and the four corner agents have only two neighbors. What effect would you hypothesize if we made our grid into a tourus which is essentially the 2D surface of a donut so there are no corners or edges. This can be specified using by setting periodic = TRUE in igraph::make_lattice when you specify the ABM graph.\n\nIf you want a larger population with more aspect ratios, that will take a longer time to run, but provides more possible combinations to test.\n\n\n\n3.5.1 Exercise 3: Reciprocity\nReciprocity can increase selection pressure towards cooperation, whereby agents can adapt their behavior with different partners depending on their cooperation history over several rounds of interactions (Nowak 2006). In other words, an agent will cooperate with those who have cooperated with them in past interactions, but defect against those who have defected agains them. There are many ways this could be implemented. The most famous is called tit-for-tat, which is the strategy where an agent will initially cooperate with a stranger, but if a partner defects against a focal agent, that focal agent will forever defect when partnered with the defecting partner. Implement tit-for-tat as a factor in agent behavior selection strategy, either in place of or in addition to social learning.\n\n\n3.5.2 Exercise 4: Interconnected communities\nThere could be cooperation or defection between communities as well as within communities. In this exercise, create two or more independent grids, then connect the grids probabilistically. For example, you might set a between_grid_connect_prob that an edge exists between any two agents/nodes from different grids. How does cooperation change with different numbers and sizes of grids, and between-grid connection probability?\nStart with the following demo command to create two grids with different sizes and create a “disjoint union” of the graphs with the %du% command in igraph. One can then rewire the union of the two grids as follows to create interconnected grids.\n\nlibrary(igraph)\ngraph &lt;- \n  igraph::make_lattice(dimvector=c(5, 4), periodic = FALSE) %du%\n  igraph::make_lattice(dimvector=c(6, 3), periodic = FALSE) %&gt;%\n  igraph::rewire(igraph::each_edge(p = 0.025, loops = FALSE))\n# Set id attribute of graphs so it's in the graph\nV(graph)$id &lt;- 1:length(V(graph))\ntbl &lt;- ggnetwork::ggnetwork(graph)\n\nggplot2::ggplot(\n    tbl, ggplot2::aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend)\n  ) + \n  ggnetwork::geom_edges() + \n  ggnetwork::geom_nodes(color = \"#347754\", size = 8) + \n  ggnetwork::geom_nodetext(ggplot2::aes(label = id), color = \"white\") + \n  ggplot2::theme_void()",

    "text": "About the Project\nSocial Science for Sustainability by Matt Turner emerged from the need for a simple, but powerful and interdisciplinary social science to teach sustainability researchers and students quantitative social science. This includes necessary computational and cognitive science topics sustainability practicioners need to know because they matter for decision making in partnerships, institutions, in governments, and online.\nI emphasize in the title that this only my take by including my name, Matt Turner. I want this to be anti-colonial. I am trying to liberate social science from disciplinary gatekeepers, not trying to become a gatekeeper, myself. I want you to be inspired to create your own Social Science for Sustainability by {Your Name Here}. In some social science disciplines, it seems there are some “holy books” that, convention states, must be cited and whose approach must be adopted. If my version of Social Science doesn’t work for you, don’t use it! Make up your own and show how it helps. Or maybe suggest ideas for this version.\nThat being said, I think the version in this project could be especially useful. I have put years into trying to understand the details of how social science can help us in our existential crisis of accelerating unsustainability, which perhaps has already spiraled beyond all control.",

    "text": "About the Author, Matt\nI am a scientist and educator dedicated to resilient, rigorous, and problem-focused social science. I am currently a Lecturer in Environmental Social Sciences at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability at Stanford University.\nIn many ways my career has built up to this point. From my physics and mathematics training I learned to use equations to calculate and understand collective dynamics, and an intuition for how to construct mechanistic scientific models of reality. As a professional software developer I upgraded my programming technicques along with domain knowledge of economics and environmental and earth sciences. In my PhD training I began consolidating all this, along with a strenuous training in social, cognitive, and behavioral sciences.\nUntil receiving my PhD in Cognitive and Information Sciences in 2021, I got my kicks cultivating a beginner’s mind by switching majors, careers, disciplines, cities, and more. All the while, many peers focused their efforts towards developing deeper expertise in fewer topics. My PhD work was the beginning of the synthesis of my work up to that point. The work presented in this Book, Curriculum, and other materials, is a continuation and extention.\nThis work was made possible by my time spent as a postdoctoral scholar mentored by James Holland Jones, with funding from a Stanford Medicine Pandemic Preparedness Hub Fellowship that enabled me to even kickstart a project to cross even more disciplinary and international borders studying urban Indigenous infection dynamics in Brazil. I hope to continue to build my collaboration with my Brazilian colleagues and expand my collaboration to include more scientists from the United States and Brazil for cultural and scientific exchange. People in these two countries face many similar cultural challenges as the largest democracies in the Americas. I myself got to spend summer 2008 learning Portuguese and living and working on astrophysics research in Brazil.\nI am motivated by a deep and humbling sense of duty to present essential social science material with a minimum cognitive overhead a maximum real-world impact. This job requires a diverse background like mine to understand the science, mathematics, computation, and philosophy of all the various social science disciplines that have something to contribute.",

    "text": "Closing: Consilience\nThis work implements a method of consilient, strategic curation of social science. Curation is a type of consolidation. In terms of scientific theories, this means the theory uses fewer types of imagined things, processes, or situations to predict real-world observations. For example, the theory of quantum mechanics consolidates physics research, helping us understand research in atomic physics and chemistry can be explained by a common set of mathematical models and computational tools.\nWhen we consolidtate theories, in social science or physics, we get a default benefit of having fewer ideas, or mental “things”, we have to keep track of in our limited working memory. Consilience is the added benefit that we often see unpredictably useful and aesthetically beautiful connections between what seemed to be disconnected scientific phenomena. In other words, a consilient theory is more than just the sum of its parts.",

    "text": "This curriculum presents the courses of the Social Science for Sustainability program currently offered by Matthew A Turner, PhD. The materials, including the companion book, socmod library, and all lecture resources, are open and freely available online.\nCourses in the curriculum share conceptual foundations including harnessing computational modeling, hands-on applications, and guided training for developing, communicating, and writing quantitative social science research. Students develop highly transferable systems thinking skills; expertise in social, cognitive, and network science; and programming proficiency in R using tidy practices, which is in high demand especially for social scienctists.\nThe program offers courses on a quarterly schedule, which leverage the persistent materials here. Courses are ten weeks of instruction in about twelve weeks that include course kick-off and finishing and presenting final projects if there are enough interested students.\nPlease Subscribe in the program to access the course lectures and other synchronous material (click button below). This is also free. You will receive lecture schedule reminders and links for easy access later; lecture previews and summaries; lecture scheduling reminders; video shorts on technical topics; and opinions, news and reviews about research in social science and beyond.\nI use Substack to handle subscriptions and content publishing. When you click the button below to subscribe, you will be taken to my substack publication Social Science for Sustainability by Matt Turner.\n\n\nSubscribe here!  ? \n\n\n\nCourses\n\nIntroduction to Social Science for Sustainability\nSchedule: Autumn 2025 (September 22 – December 20)  Syllabus\nThis introductory course weaves together strands from psychology, sociology, anthropology, and network science to understand how different learning processes can promote or inhibit the diffusion of adaptations. Through interactive lectures and computational exercises, students develop a foundation in modeling human behavior and social systems relevant to sustainability.\n\n\nAgent-Based Modeling for Sustainability\nEBS 182 / EBS 282\nSchedule: Winter 2026 (January 3 – March 24)  Syllabus\nDeveloping sustainable societies requires understanding how sustainable practices spread through complex social networks. Students learn to design, program, and analyze agent-based models simulating the social transmission of sustainable behaviors under uncertainty. Skills include high-performance computing, data analysis of large simulation outputs, and dashboarding using R and Shiny.\n\n\nOpinion Change: Modeling and Measurement\nSchedule: Spring 2026 (March 30 – June 23)  Syllabus\nOpinions shape collective outcomes, from climate policy to sustainable practices. This course explores how social influence drives opinion dynamics, covering models of extremism, polarization, and consensus formation. Students design simulations of interventions, analyze data, and produce publication-style final projects using the socmod R library.\n\n\nSummer Short Course (TBD)\nSchedule: Summer 2026 (August 3 – September 9)\nA shorter, intensive offering designed to complement the main curriculum. Details forthcoming.\n\n\n\nOpen Access & Independent Research\nThe educational materials we develop and the research we produce will always be openly available to the community. Subscribing supports the delivery of this curriculum and the development of tools, datasets, and modeling frameworks that enable independent scientific research.\n\nSubscribe here!  ?",
