    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to Social Science for Sustainability. This book develops a framework for understanding how people learn, coordinate, and act together to build a sustainable future.\nIt is an existential question whether people can join forces in sufficient volume to jolt history towards sustainable, resilient futures, and rescue ourselves from our current rut, collectively coursing towards ecological collapse. Technological solutions to climate change and environmental degradation are proliferating. But technology alone will not suffice. The critical question is: will enough people adopt sustainable practices, and under what conditions will those practices spread and endure?\nThis book shows how sustainability can benefit from a deeper understanding of social diffusion: how behaviors are transmitted, adopted, and consolidated across populations. Behaviors get transmitted through other behaviors: teaching, learning, speaking, listening, writing. Each of these is composed of a nested complex of behaviors, learned or genetically encoded. These micro-level processes scale up to collective adaptation, shaping whether communities converge on sustainable or maladaptive practices.\nThe chapters introduce a modeling framework designed to represent these processes in a way that is clear, transferable, and flexible. The framework adapts insights from evolutionary anthropology, cognitive science, psychology, and sociology, just to name a few broad disciplines. I selected topics from different disciplines based on their practical application to sustainability. Each chapter situates theory in problems of urgent concern, from climate action to cooperation over natural resources, from norm change to gender equity in leadership.\nApplications in later chapters include:\nTogether, these examples illustrate how computational models function like a “wind tunnel” for sustainability interventions. Just as cars are tested in wind tunnels before being built, interventions can be prototyped in simulations before being deployed in the world.\nThe aim is not to provide a single theory of sustainability, but rather to equip readers with tools and concepts that allow for careful reasoning, transparent assumptions, and comparative analysis across different contexts. In short: to show how social science, rigorously and creatively applied, can support the transition to a sustainable future.\nSincere thanks for your time and attention.

    "text": "1.1 Social Science for Sustainability\nHumans know how to adapt to climate change. Indigenous, local peoples of the South Pacific Islands and other coastal habitats have sustainably managed mangrove forests to dissipate storm surges and prevent erosion, mitigating potential costs of climate change since long before the anthropocene (Alongi 2002; Nalau et al. 2018; Pearson, McNamara, and Nunn 2020; McNamara et al. 2020). First peoples of western North America have similarly practiced prescribed burns to prevent destructive wildfires during times of drought for millennia (Eisenberg et al. 2019; Kolden 2019).\nDespite their effectiveness, adaptive practices like these often fail to spread widely. Instead, development agencies advocate for the construction of high-maintenance “grey infrastructure” like seawalls, even though seawalls can exacerbate flooding once breached (Piggott-McKellar et al. 2020). Inland forest management is beset by polarization among stakeholders (Swette, Huntsinger, and Lambin 2023), resulting in devastating wildfires burning a buildup of fuels or greenhouse gas-intensive clearcuts.\nUltimately our goal is to develop design principles for educational campaigns to promote viral sustainability. Achieving this requires we understand how behavior and opinions spread between people. Viral sustainability means that sustainable practices or attitudes continue to spread in a population following an educational campaign directly instructing a set of individuals I call the seed set.\nTo predict how different educational campaign strategies affect outcomes we can delineate four guiding questions:\nThe focus of this course is developing technical and domain expertise in social science that can help us simplify complex combinations of cognitive and social factors that affect whether sustainability “goes viral”.\nSocial science is immensely broad and complex comprised of numerous traditional academic disciplines in their entirety, such as anthropology and sociology, with contributions from several other traditional disciplines, including cognitive science, engineering, and physics. We use the problem of promoting sustainable practices via interventions to structure this work. Sustainability interventions are eductaion campaigns to induce the diffusion of certain adaptive, sustainable behaviors, such as in public health (Airoldi and Christakis 2024), microfinance to support gender equality at work, home, and everywhere (O’Connor and Weatherall 2018; Clydesdale and Shah 2023), and climate change adaptation via ecosystem protection (Brooks et al. 2018; McNamara et al. 2020). Following the UN SDGs, we see that this is quite a broad range of potential behaviors, which is actually a good thing. It means that our conclusions could apply to a broad range of application domains.\nOn reflection, social science for sustainability needs a science of how adaptive, sustainable behaviors, opinions, and other socially-transmitted items diffuse from person to person, throughout a population, over time. I don’t know for sure, but it seems like this may be the fundamental problem in social science, broadly understood. The puzzle of adaptation frames the overarching question of designing interventions: how best to jump-start a self-sustaining process diffusing adaptive sustainable behaviors?\nComputational social science is the use of mathematics and computers to understand and model the mechanisms underlying social diffusion phenomena, such as the adoption of sustainable practices or rising political extremism, and statistically analyze collective behavior data. We start here and for the first chapters of the book developing formal and generative models of promoting widespread behavior change. When we come to opinion change, we arrive at a natural transition point where theory necessarily meets practice to understand how to properly measure opinion change in the real world, which requires statistical inference since opinions are not directly measurable. We apply our techniques to show that\nComputational social science is a cognitive gadget to help us use social science theory for reasoning about the effect of different cognitive capacities (e.g., adaptive social learning), social processes (e.g., rising extremism), and social and natural environment constraints (e.g., social networks, wildfire risk). Too often in the history of social science, social science theory is not presented mathematically, with squishy verbal explanations of theories and their consequences instead of concrete, rigorous mathematical or computational statements, where rigorous means they are theoretically true under a set of explicitly-specified assumptions. This means that mechanisms have tended to be only vaguely specified, and changes in assumptions cannot be quantitatively, let alone systematically, explored (Turner and Smaldino 2022).\nThe UN Sustainable Development Goals help us focus and organize our work by providing concrete goals for evaluating progress towards sustainable development for all Figure 1.2. These goals include targets for institutional development that promotes basic conditions for human thriving (justice, equality, education, public health, and no poverty) so as to assemble and enable a critical mass of people to participate bringing about sustainable development. People cannot participate in sustainability if they suffer in poverty, from illness, or subjugation by authoritarians–all but the most zealous environmental defenders will fight on when these basic needs are unmet. Since progress has been slower than necessary.\nSustainability, then, has several different dimensions, all of which contribute to climate action and environmental protection. I have organized these goals into the VIBE system to guide sustainability promotion where Vibrant Institutions meet the Basic needs, including Environmental and Ecological protection. The 17 goals and how they each help catch a VIBE are illustrated in Figure 1.2.\nOrganizing and connecting our work to has two benefits. First, it helps us identify which cognitive and social factors are at work in different sustainability foci. Second, it expands the corpus of existing research on which we draw to consolidate our social and cognitive theories of behavior change that we will apply to sustainability interventions. While many of us in computational social science know our work is important as basic science partly because we are confident it can apply to real-world problems, it is not clear how. Part of this problem seems to stem from the lack of a clear goal for this science beyond evaluating alternative theories of social behavior.\nSustainability serves as a sort of never-ending Manhattan Project for social scientists, an ethically praiseworthy pursuit that will provide a selection pressure on social science frameworks or theories that theory-comparison goals cannot: our social science frameworks, theories, and models should be maximally useful to the long-term study of sustainability. That means simulations should be designed so the model parameters and outcome measures are observable and could reasonably be measured in the real-world. It means flexibly adopting different assumptions in different cases, possibly sampling from different theories that, in a different context, might make contrary predictions.",

    "section": "1.2 Social learning models",
    "text": "1.2 Social learning models\nHuman kind is set apart by powerful learning and reasoning capabilities (Witt et al. 2024) that enable cultural transmission and accumulation of technologies and practices no other species matches (Henrich 2015). For our sustainability models, we only need simple models of cognition and learning. It would never be practical to do psychological or cognitive tests in the context of sustainability interventions that targets large populations, for one thing, so we could never compare detailed cognitive assumptions or predictions with reality. For our purposes we will consider three general classes of learning strategy, with some liberty taken in switching up traditional terminologies in the pursuit of a leaner, more descriptive semantic system for this framework.\nWe model the learning process as contagion, conformity, or vicarity:\n\nContagion: Someone observing a behavior copies that behavior at random with a given probability called the adoption rate.\nConformity: People prefer doing more popular behaviors to less popular ones.\nVicarity: People prefer learning from peers who are successful. “Success” here is strategically ambiguous—it could be in terms of happiness, mindfulness, spiritual connection, wealth, power, etc.\n\nIn the mangrove versus seawall example, vicarity could be harnessed to promote sustainable mangrove forest management if its benefits were widely known. If instead conformist attitudes prevailed within an echo chamber of pro-seawall actors, education may be of little help without stronger institutional support of free, democratic, and self-interested choice. ## Identity and Influence\nGroup identity critically influences social learning. Neuroscience research demonstrates that our brains distinctly respond to individuals identified as part of our group (Cikara and Van Bavel 2014), as revealed through fMRI neural imaging (Figure 1.3). This ability likely evolved because when humans first emerged about two million years ago, it was much more important for survival to be able to rapidly identify whether someone was a friend or foe based on group markers. Although group membership can affect how we respond to information learned from others, group membership itself is quite plastic, meaning who belongs to which group can be rapidly reconfigured. For example, neural signals of race-based group perception was observed to be suppressed and overridden when individuals were in mixed-race groups created by experimenters that competed against other mixed-race groups in an psychological experimental task (Van Bavel, Packer, and Cunningham 2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Figure 1 reorganized with original caption from Cikara and Van Bavel (2014)\n\n\n\nStudies further show that group identity can strongly influence behavioral choices. For instance, experimental evidence reveals people resist adopting beneficial behaviors if associated with opposing political identities (Ehret et al. 2022), emphasizing how identity can create substantial barriers to sustainability. This general effect of group membership interfering with learning is called outgroup aversion (Smaldino et al. 2017).",

    "text": "1.3 Identity, homophily, and social networks shape viral sustainability\nSocial structure can significantly impact behavioral diffusion, especially in core-periphery configurations. Core-periphery networks emerge as a response to risk and uncertainty, e.g., in food sharing networks (Ready and Power 2018), so they are hypothesized to also be important in climate change adaptation transmission networks (Jones, Ready, and Pisor 2021). Core-periphery networks can be created by setting appropriate group sizes and homophily levels in homophily network models (Turner et al. 2023) or specifying certain connectivity probabilities to the stochastic block matrix algorithm for creating structured random graphs (Rombach et al. 2014; Milzman and Moser 2023). Homophily is the measure of how much more likely an individual is to socially connect within their own group versus with a member of a different group. Homophily can range from -1 to +1, where -1 represents no within-group connections and only between-group connections (i.e., anti-homophily); 0 represents an equal probability of within- and between-group connections, and +1 represents only within-group connections. We will define homophily as either a global or group-level variable, though homophily could vary individually as well. There are two types of homophily:\n\nChoice Homophily: Individuals actively prefer interacting with similar others.\nInduced Homophily: Social interactions limited by historical or external conditions like geography, profession, birthplace, etc.\n\nThese structural elements can significantly limit the diffusion of sustainable practices from peripheries, like the mangrove management on smaller islands, to central cores. However, as colleagues and I have showed, this core-periphery structure, defined by moderately high majority-group homophily can actually promote the diffusion of adaptations, provided the adaptation is practiced by the minority group (Turner et al. 2023), as is the case for mangrove forest management or prescribed burns.",

    "text": "1.4 We don’t observe “opinions”: Why opinion influence is different from learning behaviors\nOpinions are not behaviors. They cannot be directly observed, only inferred from behavior. A person planting mangroves or conducting a prescribed burn produces a visible, specific, measurable action. An “opinion” is only constructed in relation to some prompt, like survey responses that political scientists use to poll the electorate on policies and politicians (Zaller and Feldman 1992). Cognitive scientists and psychologists developed other ways to access peoples’ opinions, such as through the timing of keypresses to reveal racial prejudice in an implicit bias test (Greenwald et al. 2009), or using computational linguistic analysis of sentiment analysis (Cody et al. 2015).\nPolitical polarization, when partisans radicalize, makes institutions freeze. Sustainability needs strong institutions to ensure basic needs are met and basic human rights are protected (see bottom row in Figure 1.2). To make things worse, polarization hampers sustainability debates, actively obscuring moderate, win-win solutions and elevating partisan policies.\nIndigenous practices we reviewed seem to be ignored at least partly because polarized opinions prevent their consideration and adoption. The same holds for coastal mangrove restoration, renewable energy policy, basic conservation, and in numerous other sustainability problems. People can be—and often are—openly hostile to sustainability for reasons that have little to do with evidence or experience. If opinions are the supposed bridge between psychology and large-scale social shifts, then building strategies on flawed opinion science is like trying to engineer a suspension bridge without knowing how steel bends.\n\n1.4.1 Models and measurements of opinion change\nOpinion science needs, but currently lacks, a tight integration of theoretical and computational modeling and experimental design. Here I’ll explain what we need and how theory, modeling, and measurement complement one another through a case study applied to group polarization, which we expand on in more detail in the opinion change post in the Lecture Notes, soon to be another chapter in this online book.\n\nModels\nOn the modeling side, frameworks like DeGroot’s consensus model or Macy’s Hopfield adaptations generate elegant dynamics of attraction, repulsion, or indifference. But these are mechanisms acting on theoretical constructs, not on directly measurable behaviors. On the measurement side, researchers routinely treat ordinal data—Likert scales of “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”—as if they were continuous. This sleight of hand allows ANOVAs and regressions to spit out “effects” that may be nothing more than statistical artifacts. Replications don’t fix this; they repeat the same errors. What we call “opinion change” is too often a reflection of our instruments, not of anything happening in people’s minds.\n\n\nMeasurements\n\nTo measure opinion change we need a rigorous method (Liddell and Kruschke 2018)",

    "text": "1.5 Discussion\nLet’s close this chapter by reviewing the dimensions of evaluating the metaphor of viral sustainability to describe the kind of self-sustaining diffusion we’re after. It’s worth unpacking this metaphor.\nViral here is intended to capture the familiar self-sustaining diffusion of fashions and fads. Friends and associates tell one another about what they’re up to and how it’s going. Sometimes they try out what each other are doing then keep doing it because it works for them. If this happens again and again over time, and more people are starting to do something more frequently than people are stopping doing it. The similarity of this process to the spread of pathogens in epidemiology is exactly where the term viral, in the parlance of our times, with apparently wide shared agreement about its meaning. Viruses and other pathogens spread when people interact, while also sometimes rapidly evolving to evade our efforts to stop them.\n(LARGELY AI GENERATED BELOW TO MARGIN COLUMN NOTE, ALSO AI GENERATED) In culture, virality is uneven and stochastic: some sparks flare out, while others cascade unexpectedly. In philosophy, viral processes blur agency—no one controls the spread, it emerges from many small acts. This makes viral sustainability a natural metaphor for the pluralism of social life: many hands, many voices, converging without central command into collective action.\nBut viral is only one register. Evolutionary biologists might call the same thing niche construction: once behaviors spread, they reshape the ecological and social environment in ways that feed back to support further spread. Cultural theorists like Sperber would call the stable outcomes cultural attractors: convergent points that diffusion tends to settle on, even through noisy transmission. And systems theorists use autopoiesis—literally “self-making”—to describe when a practice or institution doesn’t just persist but actively reproduces the conditions of its own existence.\nThese frames are not mutually exclusive and don’t need a strict mapping onto stages of a diffusion curve. Instead, they’re complementary lenses. Viral captures the ignition and pluralistic energy of spread; niche construction and attractors highlight how environments and cognition stabilize practices; autopoiesis emphasizes the long-term maintenance of systems that can regenerate themselves. Together, they give us a richer intuition for what it might mean for sustainable behaviors not only to diffuse but to take root and endure.\n\n\n\n\n(MOSTLY AI GENERATED) Viral, niche construction, and autopoiesis offer complementary lenses—ignition and pluralistic spread, stabilization through environment and cognition, and long-term self-maintenance—that together deepen our intuition for how sustainability can diffuse and endure.\n\n\nAiroldi, Edoardo M., and Nicholas A.

CALCULUS AND OTHER MATHEMATICAL TOPICS WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE UPDATED VERSION FOR FALL 2025 QUARTER.\nThis section introduces agent-based modeling in socmod starting with basic functional and object-oriented programming in R. It therefore builds on an assumed knowledge of R basics which can be gained by studying, for example, Hands-On Programming with R or other basic R tutorial introductions.\nTo model social behavior it helps to have intuitive software tools grounded in an empirically-motivated, self-consistent scientific theory. socmod provides those tools, but to put it to best use it’s helpful to know how it works, especially for people used to using R in a data science context. Many of the same tools are transferable, especially declarative/functional programming, as is used and encouraged by the tidy approach in R for Data Science.\nTo create simulations that generate social behavior we have to go beyond tabular representations of the world to more complex representations of people and their interactions that can be measured. These measurements are recorded in a standard tabular format, e.g., CSV, which can then be analyzed using tidy/R for Data Science strategies.\nIn agent-based modeling, we create software representations of simulated people, i.e. agents, or other interacting entities, including the agents’ environment. Object-oriented programming is the natural choice for software design in this case because it provides a structure for defining custom objects like socially interacting agents. An object is one bit of data that could be a number or character type, but could also be something more complicated. In object-oriented programming we define custom classes that specify various data fields and function methods for maintaining and modifying the state of objects. The fields and methods of a class therefore are sets of related data and functions to represent things in the world.\nTo summarize, objects are a way to track and modify the state of different software entities. We can create simulations of real-world systems by defining custom object types called classes whose state and behaviors are modeled on relevant real-world features and behaviors.\nIn socmod, we define custom R objects for agent-based models of social behavior using the R6Class method that creates a new object type, i.e., a new class. We use tidy-style functional programming where helpful to represent model features and dynamics.\nIn the remainder of this chapter, I will first review variable assignment and data structures in R including vectors, lists, data.frames, and tibbles. We then review relevant topics in functional programming, then demonstrate how to create custom classes in R with the library R6. This tutorial then closes with a demonstration of a simple four-agent agent-based model of social behavior, kept simple to highlight the functional and object-oriented design patterns in socmod, representing Agent, an AgentBasedModel, and Trialclasses defined using the R6Class function.",

    "section": "2.2 Data collection types in R",
    "text": "2.2 Data collection types in R\nIn R, there is a hierarchy of data collection types that are necessary to know about for functional programming, which often involves applying a function across every element of a collection of data. Data collections include vectors, lists, data.frames, and tibbles, which we’ll cover here.\n\n2.2.1 Collections of basic data types\nIn computer science, a collection is an abstract data type that organizes and stores instances of other data types. In R, the most basic data types are numbers (e.g., double or integer) and text, whose data type is character in R whether it’s a single character or several:\n\nprint(typeof('c'))\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\nprint(typeof(\"social science is kewl\"))\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Vectors\nR vectors are defined using the c() function, e.g., vec &lt;- c(0, 0, 1). The data type of all vector elements must be the same. This is enforced by R coercing data to different types, for example:\n\nprint(c(0, 0, 1))\n\n[1] 0 0 1\n\nprint(c(0, 0, \"yo\"))\n\n[1] \"0\"  \"0\"  \"yo\"\n\n\nWe index vectors using single square brackets, with R indexing starting from 1:\n\nvec &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # equiv to vec &lt;- 1:5 or seq(1, 5)\nprint(vec[1])\n\n[1] 1\n\nprint(vec[length(vec)])\n\n[1] 5\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Lists\nIf one wants to keep elements of different types in a single collection, use the R list:\n\nl &lt;- list(0, 542, \"yo\")\nprint(l)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 0\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 542\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"yo\"\n\n\nNote the visual representation has changed on printout. We now need to use double-square brackets to index list elements themselves:\n\nprint(l[[3]])\n\n[1] \"yo\"\n\n\nIf we leave off one of the square brackets we effectively get a sub-list with just one element:\n\nprint(l[3])\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"yo\"\n\n\nThis is useful if you want to create a new sub-list with more than one element:\n\nprint(l[c(2, 3)])\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 542\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"yo\"\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Named lists\nNamed lists are the primary key-value store in R, just like dict in Python. It allows us to label entries of the list and access them using double square brackets with the character name or using the $ access operator:\n\nnamed_l &lt;- list(a = c(0, 5, 6), b = c(7, 8, 9))\nprint(named_l$a == named_l[[\"a\"]]) # compares element-by-element\n\n[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE\n\nprint(all(named_l$b == named_l[[\"b\"]]))\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5 tibble (and data.frame)\nBoth the tibble and data.frame classes represent tabular data, meaning data that can be represented in table format, e.g., in comma- or tab-separated value format. There are some subtle differences listed below, but we’ll use tibble for representing our tables.\nTibbles are like fancy lists that have special properties that make data manipulation more efficient. The details of how this works aren’t super important at this point. The important thing to know is how one can initialize tibbles and access tibble columns similarly to lists, as shown in the following example:\n\ntbl &lt;- tibble::tibble(a = c(0, 5, 6), b = c(7, 8, 9))\nprint(tbl$a)\n\n[1] 0 5 6\n\nprint(tbl[[\"b\"]])\n\n[1] 7 8 9\n\n\nUsing tibbles ensures that data manipulation and analysis using the tidyverse will work as expected. For example, the tidyverse provides functions for analyzing different groups of data within a larger dataset. This is a common data analysis pattern called split-apply-combine, which in the tidyverse translates to group-by and summarise when using the dplyr library. For example, we can calculate the mean of measurements in “experimental” and “control” conditions in some fake data:\n\nobservations &lt;- tibble::tibble(\n  condition = c(\"experimental\", \"experimental\", \"control\", \"control\"),\n  measurement = c(13.5, 14.6, 3.4, 5.4)\n)\n\nmean_measurement_tbl &lt;- \n  observations %&gt;% \n  dplyr::group_by(condition) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::summarise(mean_measurement = mean(measurement))\n\nprint(mean_measurement_tbl)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  condition    mean_measurement\n  &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 control                   4.4\n2 experimental             14.0\n\n\n\n\n2.2.6 Difference between data.frame and tibble\nThe tibble library provides a table data representation (also called tibble) that is a bit more flexible and intuitive than the R built-in data.frame. One reason I prefer tibbles is because traditional data.frames automatically convert strings to factors unless you tell them not to. Tibbles don’t, so you’re never surprised.\nColumn naming is also more flexible with tibbles. A data.frame requires syntactically valid R names, while tibbles can handle column names that include spaces or even non-standard characters. I often use this feature to use column names like Mean adaptation success that print nicely when used as labels in ggplot.\nFinally, tibble operations always return a tibble. For example, if df were a data.frame, the operation df[, 1] would return a vector by default. If it were a tibble it would return another tibble, making behavior more predictable in data analysis pipelines.",

    "section": "2.3 Functional programming",
    "text": "2.3 Functional programming\nFunctional programming is especially useful for writing code that applies the same function to several inputs, but wants to leave it up to the user to specify exactly which function should be applied. In socmod we pass functions as arguments to other functions to specify how agents pick their interaction partners (i.e., teachers in a learning context) and how social learning works. Here are some simple examples demonstrating the key concepts and techniques of functional programming that could help with socmod programming.\n\n2.3.1 Higher-order functions: functions with function arguments\nIn R, and other programming languages supporting the functional style, one can treat functions like any other data and pass it as an argument to other functions. A function that accepts a function as an argument is called a higher-order function. Here is a simple example of a higher order function that takes some data as a first argument and applies the function f to that data twice, putting the result of each calculation in a two-element vector.\n\nrepeat_2_higher_order_func &lt;- function(data, f) {\n  return (c(f(data), f(data)))\n}\n\nBelow we call this higher order function by providing data=2 as the first argument and an anonymous function as the second argument, which can be written using \\(arg) { ...function body... } syntax:\n\n# \\(x) {...} is equivalent to function(x) { ... }; these are \n# anonymous functions.\n# Expecting to return c(4, 4)\nrepeat_2_higher_order_func(data = 2, f = \\(x) { return (x * 2) }) \n\n[1] 4 4\n\n\nThe above is the representation of a vector printed to screen, so we see that our expectations were matched.\n\nc(4, 4)\n\n[1] 4 4\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 map: a common, useful higher-order function used often in socmod\nOne of the most useful and common higher-order functions is the map function. This function maps a function, denoted .f below, onto every element in a collection, denoted .x. This notation is from the map family of functions in the purrr library for tidy functional programming.\n\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nHere is an example of mapping an anonymous function that multiplies its input by 3 onto a vector with entries 2 and 8:\n\n# Now get we use map_vec that applies .f to every element of .x,\n# expecting the following to return a vector with elements 3*2 \n# and 3*8, i.e., c(6, 24).\npurrr::map_vec(.x = c(2, 8), .f = \\(x) { return(3 * x)})\n\n[1]  6 24\n\n\nIf we want to apply a function that takes two variables, the value and index of an element in a collection, we can use the imap family of functions as follows to return a vector that contains the original element multiplied by its place in the input vector:\n\ninput_vec &lt;- c(2, 5050, 6)\npurrr::imap_vec(input_vec, \\(el, idx) { return (idx * el) })\n\n[1]     2 10100    18",

    "text": "2.4 Custom objects: R6 classes in socmod\nClasses are ways to encapsulate diverse distinct, but related, processes, behaviors, data, attributes, and other types of information in a single object, i.e., a software representation of an instance of that entity. R6 is a library for creating our own custom classes that serve as an abstract template that specifies what distinguishes different types of objects/entities. Below we show first how to create a new agent, i.e., a new instance of the Agent class that is provided by socmod. After that is a fun example of how we can design a different social behavioral model, one of football/soccer matches. We write classes for players and teams and develop a play_match(team1, team2) function that pits two teams against each other.\n\n2.4.1 The Agent class in socmod\nBelow we create a new instance of the Agent class using the class constructor, the function written socmod::Agent$new() below that creates a new instance of the class.\n\na1 &lt;- socmod::Agent$new(1, name = \"Matt\", \n                        behavior = \"Adaptive\", \n                        fitness=1e6)\n\nWe can use the access operator, $ in R, to access the fields (i.e., attributes) of agent a1 like so:\n\nprint(a1$get_fitness())\n\n[1] 1e+06\n\nprint(a1$get_name())\n\n[1] \"Matt\"\n\nprint(a1$get_id())\n\n[1] 1\n\nprint(a1$get_behavior())\n\n[1] \"Adaptive\"\n\n\nWe can also use purrr::map functions over neighbors like so:\n\n# Assign neighbors to a1.\n\na1$set_neighbors(c(\n  socmod::Agent$new(id = 2, name = \"n2\"),\n  socmod::Agent$new(id = 3, name = \"n3\")\n))\n\n# Get the list of neighbors back to check it worked.\nneighbors &lt;- a1$get_neighbors()\nprint(class(neighbors))  # should be [1] \"Neighbors\" \"R6\"\n\n[1] \"Neighbors\" \"R6\"       \n\n# Neighbors$map() returns a list...\nneighbor_names &lt;- neighbors$map(\\(n) n$get_name())\nprint(neighbor_names)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"n2\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"n3\"\n\n# ...use `unlist` to convert it to a vector:\nprint(unlist(neighbor_names))\n\n[1] \"n2\" \"n3\"\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Exercise: design and define classes from scratch\nIn class we started creating our model of a soccer player agent called Footballer, defined below. We ran out of time at the end of class to write methods for Footballer, i.e., ways that a football player could interact with the world, or that the world could act upon a soccer player. However we only had time to create a stub for two methods. A stub is a minimal chunk of code that does very little to nothing, but doesn’t get in the way by causing errors or anything like that. It enables us to document our plans for future development in the exact place where it would happen in the code.\nBelow we have stubs for score_goal and get_penalty methods for in-game behaviors. Other possibilities could include get_traded that would change its team and perhaps get_signed for cases where a player is a free agent.\n\nlibrary(R6)\n\nFootballer &lt;- R6Class(\"Footballer\",\n                        \n  public = list(\n    # Listing attributes as fields and \n    # setting to zero for their definition.\n    speed = 0.0,  # units of max km/h\n    accuracy = 0.0, # probability of scoring on a shot\n    market_value = 0.0, # \n    aggressiveness = 0.0, # units of penalties per match\n    team = \"\",\n    \n    initialize = function(speed = 15, \n                          accuracy = 0.2, market_value = 1e6, \n                          aggressiveness = 0.5, \n                          team = \"Free agent\") {\n      self$speed = speed\n      self$accuracy = accuracy\n      self$market_value = market_value\n      self$aggressiveness = aggressiveness\n      self$team = team\n    },\n    \n    # Stub two SoccerPlayer class methods...\n    # ...one for scoring a goal in a game...\n    scored_goal = function() {\n      return (ifelse(runif(1) &lt; self$accuracy, 1, 0))\n    },\n    # ...and one for getting a penalty in a game.\n    get_penalty_on_play = function() {\n      return (runif(1) &lt; self$aggressiveness)\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nTeam &lt;- R6Class(\"Team\",\n                \n  public = list(\n    name = \"\",\n    players = list(),\n    wins = 0,\n    ties = 0,\n    payroll = 0,\n    games_played = 0,\n    \n    # Team name is required, with players optionally specified.\n    initialize = function(name, players = list()) {\n\n      self$name = name\n\n      # Initialize players and payroll.\n      for (player in players) {\n        self$payroll &lt;- self$payroll + player$market_value\n        player$team &lt;- name\n      }\n\n      self$players &lt;- players\n    },\n    \n    # Add a player to the roster.\n    sign_player = function(player) {\n      # Add the player to the team.\n      self$players &lt;- c(players, player)\n      # Update payroll.\n      self$payroll &lt;- self$payroll + player$market_value\n      # Update the player's team to be this team's name.\n      player$team &lt;- self$name\n    }\n  )\n)\n\n\nfootballer &lt;- Footballer$new(accuracy = 0.5)\nfootballer$scored_goal()\n\n[1] 0\n\n# sum(purrr::map_vec(1:10, \\(.) p$scored_goal()))\n\nWe can define a function that simulates playing a football match where the team that scores more goals wins, or a tie if teams have the same score.

We leave it to the reader as an exercise to make use of the Footballer$get_penalty_on_play() method within the game to add penalties and consequences in the game (e.g., penalty kicks or something), and to use the Team$sign_player() add more players to each roster, which should increase the mean total scores in each game based on the simple way we’ve modeled gameplay in play_match.\n\n# Define a function that models a football match.\nplay_match &lt;- function(team1, team2) {\n  \n  # Walk over each player to see how many scores they get, \n  # summing to get the total team score. \n  team1_score &lt;- sum(\n    purrr::map_vec(\n      team1$players,\n      \\(player) {\n      # Calculate the total goals scored by the current player.\n        sum(purrr::map_vec(1:10, \\(.) player$scored_goal()))\n      }\n    ) \n  )\n  \n  team2_score &lt;- sum(\n    purrr::map_vec(\n      team2$players,\n      \\(player) {\n      # Calculate the total goals scored by the current player.\n        sum(purrr::map_vec(1:10, \\(.) player$scored_goal()))\n      }\n    ) \n  )\n  \n  if (team1_score == team2_score) {\n    team1$ties &lt;- team1$ties + 1\n    team2$ties &lt;- team2$ties + 1\n    cat(\"Tie game!\\n\")\n  } else if (team1_score &gt; team2_score) {\n    cat(team1$name, \"wins!!!\\n\")\n    team1$wins &lt;- team1$wins + 1\n  } else {\n    cat(team2$name, \"wins!!!\\n\")\n    team2$wins &lt;- team2$wins + 1\n  }\n  \n  cat(team1$name, \": \", team1_score, \"   \",  \n      team2$name, \": \", team2_score, \"\\n\")\n  \n  team1$games_played &lt;- team1$games_played + 1\n  team2$games_played &lt;- team2$games_played + 1\n}\n\nFirst we need teams, which we create and to which we assign players using the constructor, Team$new() in the code below.\n\n# Initialize two teams, Whales and Squirrels, each with two\n# players.

    "section": "2.5 An aside on copy vs reference semantics in R: assignment and mutation",
    "text": "2.5 An aside on copy vs reference semantics in R: assignment and mutation\nWhen you change something in R, sometimes R makes a copy of the object so the original stays the same, and sometimes it changes the object by reference, meaning it updates the original directly. Understanding whether an operation creates a new copy or modifies an object in place (called mutation) is important because it affects whether you need to assign the result back to a variable or not. Even though this idea is usually taught in more advanced programming, it’s useful for beginners working with modeling and simulation because different parts of R (like data frames vs. agent-based models) follow different rules, and knowing which is which can help avoid confusing bugs.\n\n2.5.1 1. The underlying tension: how R handles object copying and modification\nAt the heart of R’s behavior lies a subtle technical distinction: whether an object is copied or modified in place when you change it. By default, R uses copy-on-modify semantics, meaning that if you change an object, R creates a new copy behind the scenes and leaves the original unchanged. This protects your data from unintended side effects and reflects R’s origins as a functional programming language for statistics. But as R evolved to support more object-oriented programming and to interface with other languages like C and C++, it introduced types of objects—such as environments, external pointers, and R6 classes—that instead use reference semantics. With these objects, changes happen directly to the object itself without making a copy. Internally, R’s i nterpreter keeps track of when it needs to copy or reuse memory, but these mechanics aren’t always visible, which can lead to surprises when working with more complex objects.\n\n\n2.5.2 2. A practical guide for navigating copy and reference semantics\nFor most core R data types—vectors, lists, data frames—you can assume that R makes a copy whenever you modify an object. But for certain kinds of objects, especially environments, R6 classes (used in socmod), and graphs from the igraph package, the behavior is different: these follow reference semantics, meaning they’re modified directly. In socmod, all models and agents are implemented using R6 classes, so when you call something like model$set_parameter(\"n_agents\", 100), the model’s state is updated directly and immediately—no need to reassign model &lt;- .... This makes working with simulations feel more natural, but it also means that habits from working with regular R objects don’t fully apply. A simple rule of thumb: if it’s an R6 object or a special object like an igraph graph, expect it to behave by reference; otherwise, expect copy-on-modify.\n\n\n2.5.3 3. How igraph fits in: working with C-backed graphs in R\nMuch of igraph isn’t written in R itself, but in another programming language called C. C allows developers to write code that’s much faster and more efficient than what’s possible in R alone. This efficiency is great for users—igraph can handle large networks quickly—but it also introduces a subtle complication to how we work with graphs in R. When you modify an igraph object, you’re actually asking C code to change the graph behind the scenes. But instead of directly changing the graph you already have, igraph’s functions usually return a new graph object with the changes applied. This means that even though igraph mostly follows reference semantics (where an object can be updated without copying everything), you still need to explicitly reassign the result of a modification to keep the updated graph. It’s different from how socmod’s models and agents work: those are built with R6 classes, which really do modify objects “in place” without needing reassignment.",

We can directly create the social network using igraph::make_graph() then set it as the model’s social network, along with setting the learning strategy to be contagion learning.\nThe adoption_rate parameter specifies how likely another agent is to adopt the adaptive behavior when exposed to it. The drop_rate is how likely an agent doing the adaptive behavior is to stop doing it and revert to the non-adaptive behavior.\n\n2.6.1 Example 1: Time series of adaptation diffusion\n\nadoption_rate = 0.8\n \n# Run model with \ng &lt;- igraph::make_graph(~ 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 3-2)\nmps &lt;- make_model_parameters(\n  contagion_model_dynamics, graph = g, adoption_rate = 0.8, drop_rate = 0.1\n)\ncabm &lt;- make_abm(mps); \ncabm$get_agent(2)$set_behavior(\"Adaptive\"); \ntrial &lt;- run_trial(cabm, stop = fixated)\nplot_prevalence(trial, tracked_behaviors = c(\"Adaptive\", \"Legacy\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Same, but now call the adaptive behavior \"Baglowie\" instead of \"Adaptive\".\ng &lt;- igraph::make_graph(~ 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 3-2)\nmps &lt;- make_model_parameters(\n  contagion_model_dynamics, graph = g, adoption_rate = 0.8, drop_rate = 0.1\n)\n\ncabm &lt;- make_abm(mps)\ncabm$get_agent(2)$set_behavior(\"Baglowie\"); \n\ntrial &lt;- run_trial(cabm, stop = fixated, adaptive_behavior = \"Baglowie\")\nplot_prevalence(trial, tracked_behaviors = c(\"Legacy\", \"Baglowie\"))",

    "text": "3.1 Introduction\nThis chapter introduces how behaviors spread through social learning and why this process is central to sustainability. We begin by framing behavior diffusion in terms of prevalence — the fraction of people in a population practicing a behavior — and show how different learning rules (contagion, conformity, success-bias) can be expressed within a single mathematical framework, the prevalence dynamic. We then show how to measure collective adaptation through outcome measures such as success rate and time to fixation, using computational experiments. Applications demonstrate how this framework clarifies the strengths and weaknesses of different learning rules, why conformity cannot drive adaptation by itself, and why minority groups play an essential role in sustainability. The chapter closes with a preview of diffusion in networks, setting the stage for the following chapter.\nSustainable action, whether it is adopting renewable energy, changing agricultural practices, or reducing inequality, is ultimately a matter of how behaviors spread. Behaviors spread because people learn from one another. This process of social learning over time is the fundamental mechanism of collective adaptation.\nCollective adaptation is represented in terms of the prevalence of a sustainable adaptation — the fraction of people in a population who practice the adaptive behavior. To quantify the effects of different social, cognitive, and ecological factors on adaptation prevalence we need a way to mathematically describe how people learn from each other over time.",

    "text": "3.1.1 Introducing The Prevalence Dynamic\nThe prevalence dynamic represents collective adaptation (or maladaptation) as the aggregation of individual-level behavior decisions. At its core, the prevalence dynamic tracks two probabilities: the chance that a person switches from the legacy behavior to the adaptive behavior (adoption probability) and the chance that a person switches back from the adaptive to the legacy behavior (drop probability). By combining these probabilities with the current prevalence of each behavior, we obtain a dynamic description of how behavior spreads in a population.\n\n\n3.1.2 Social Learning Models\nWe represent learning and behavior choice, the benefits of behaviors, and the passage of time in different ways to create different models of social behavior. Different models are formed by making strategic choices of sub-models that represent parts of the behavior diffusion process. A given behavior diffusion model is identified by its particular choices for sub-models. Abstract diffusion models can then be identified along theoretical “dimensions.”\nOne of the major theoretical dimensions for modeling behavior diffusion is the social learning model itself. Social learning can take many complex forms operating in vastly different ways. However, we focus on three idealized models at this point, labeled to help us “index” different diffusion processes: contagion (a learner “catches” a behavior for whatever reason), conformity (learners are more likely to adopt the behavior that seems most common), and success-biased partner selection (learners prefer successful teachers).\nThe other theoretical dimension is the population structure. Model population structure is defined by the population’s (1) size and group sizes, and (2) interaction structure — who can learn from whom — which can be encoded in a model social network.\n\nComparison of Learning Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning model\nCore intuition\nAdoption rule\nDrop rule\nKey limitation\n\n\n\n\nContagion\nBehaviors spread like infections\n\\(P(A \\mid L) = \\alpha a\\)\n\\(P(L \\mid A) = \\delta\\)\nCaptures “catchiness” but ignores success or prestige\n\n\nSuccess-biased\nPeople copy the more successful\n\\(P(A \\mid L) \\propto af_A\\)\n\\(P(L \\mid A) \\propto (1-a) f_L\\)\nRequires defining and measuring success\n\n\nConformity\nPeople join the majority\n\\(P(A \\mid L) \\propto a^{1+\\gamma}\\)\n\\(P(L \\mid A) \\propto (1-a)^{1+\\gamma}\\)\nCannot spread initially rare behaviors; fixation only by drift\n\n\n\nHere “adoption probability” means the chance that someone currently practicing the legacy behavior switches to the adaptive behavior, while “drop probability” means the chance that someone currently practicing the adaptive behavior reverts to the legacy behavior.\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Model Implementations\nEach learning model can be implemented in different mathematical ways, depending on how we represent the population and how much randomness we allow.

We show how the same framework can capture different learning rules — contagion, success-biased learning, and conformity — by specifying their adoption and drop probabilities. These probabilities are written as functions of the current prevalence of each behavior, since learning requires others to be present who already practice the behavior and can serve as models. In this way, prevalence itself drives the dynamics.\nIn Section 3, we use these models to explore applications to sustainability. We begin with exemplary applications: comparing prevalence dynamics with different learning models, analyzing why conformity can only lead to fixation through drift, and extending the framework to cases with minority and majority groups. Even these simplified models provide important lessons: collective adaptation works best when people are educated to evaluate the benefits and risks of different behaviors; collective adaptation can never happen through conformity alone if adaptive behaviors are initially rare; and minority groups must be included as participants and highlighted as leaders in sustainability interventions. To understand more specific questions, like how social network structure affects diffusion, we will need additional techniques, which we take up in subsequent chapters.\nThe chapter closes by reflecting on what these different learning rules mean for promoting sustainable practices in the real world, emphasizing when and how social learning can help collective action succeed.",

    "text": "3.2 Prevalence Dynamic\nThe prevalence dynamics modeling framework provides a structure for various modeling choices one could make to represent social diffusion of behaviors. This framework includes explains which choices could be useful in which socio-ecological contexts. Sustainability provides social science an important challenge to identify principles that could predict how likely different sustainability interventions are to succeed, and to examine how the prevalence of sustainable behaviors change over time.\nIn this section I explain how this framework can address this challenge by first introducing the prevalence dynamic in a series of forms, starting with the mathematical form. Next in this section, I explain how to create agent-based models of social diffusion using socmod. The prevalence dynamic can be used to create quantitative models of behavior diffusion, generating simulated observations of the prevalence of behaviors over time. We also measure simulated outcomes of whether or not a simulated intervention was successful. Simulations count as successful if all or some large fraction of individuals adopt a sustainable adaptive behavior.\nWe will apply this framework to generate some important insights for intervention design in the following section, Applications. For now we start by explaining the structure of a social diffusion simulation by first sketching options for representing the social learning process, i.e., the social learning model. The prevalence dynamic is the foundation for quantitative simulations of individuals learning from others over a series of simulated time steps. Simulations can be implemented and analyzed with math or code, also explained in more detail below.\n\n3.2.1 The Prevalence Dynamic\nIn these models we assume there are two possible behaviors, or classes of behaviors, that individuals can do. These are called the Adaptive behavior or practice, or behavior \\(A\\) for short. The non-adaptive or maladaptive behavior is the Legacy behavior, i.e., the business-as-usual behavior. An individual who does the adaptive behavior is an \\(A\\)-doer, and one doing the legacy behavior is an \\(L\\)-doer.\nTo represent interventions, we initialize agent populations with one behavior or the other, specify environmental or ecological conditions such as the apparent benefit of different behaviors, and set agent learning strategies. Learning strategies that we consider are contagion (probabilistic adoption on exposure), success-biased learning (successful individuals are more likely to be chosen as teachers), and conformity or frequency-biased learning (more prevalent behaviors are more likely to be adopted).\nThe model represents time in steps. On each time step, agents select partners, interact, and update behaviors based on outcomes and learning rules. These steps are repeated until specific conditions or thresholds are met. Stopping conditions are typically specified as when a maximum time step is reached, when the entire population fixates (i.e., all do the same) on one behavior or the other. After the model stops, the dynamics can be inspected or the outcomes can be aggregated across simulations in the case of agent-based modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Agent-based modeling simulation cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Formal models of diffusion\nIn the next chapter I explain how to develop various formal models of behavior diffusion that represent changes in prevalence of different behaviors.\n\nCollective Adaptation through Individual Decisions\n(EXPLAIN THE MODELING APPROACH, TAKING IT FROM THE INTRODUCTION)\n\n\nAgent-based models of diffusion\nAgent-based models (ABMs) provide a structured way to explore complex systems by simulating interactions between autonomous agents, i.e., simulated people. In sustainability contexts, ABMs offer a low-cost testbed for understanding how interventions might impact social dynamics and environmental outcomes. For example, Airoldi and Christakis (2024) demonstrated through regression analysis across that one method for selecting individuals targeted in a public health education campaign worked better than another. They studied over 20,000 individuals across Honduran villages of about 100 people each to reach their findings. Real-world verification of the efficacy of different intervention strategies is important. However, we can also use agent-based models to represent the diffusion of information in simulated populations where interactions are structured by model social networks. We can initialize thousands or millions of simulated villages in which this information could diffuse with different intervention strategies, and observe the distribution of the adoption of sustainable behaviors for each potential intervention strategy. We can then analyze which performed best in silico, which can be helpful if interventions will be taken to different contexts. In other worlds, we can use ABMs to deduce how different learning rules, group identities, and social structures shape sustainability outcomes generally, which can guide our selection of real-world intervention strategies.\nWe will analyze and draw on several real-world empirical studies of interventions to develop our agent-based models that we in turn will use to simulate interventions in order to deduce which strategies are most effective for social interventions to promote sustainability, and why. A social intervention (or just intervention) for promoting sustainability is any concerted effort where those promoting a sustainable practice introduces information about how to perform that practice to a population. Deductive methods complement regression-based inferential or inductive strategies. Deductive strategies can explain which strategies are most effective and why in idealized, cost-free settings (cost-free at least compared to the cost of real-world social interventions at scale).\nLow-cost experimentation with simulated social interventions to promote sustainability are critical. Unless progress is accelerated towards we can expect to “have 575 million people living in extreme poverty, 600 million people facing hunger, and 84 million children and young people out of school. Humanity will overshoot the Paris climate agreement’s 1.5°C ‘safe’ guardrail on…temperature rise. And, at the current rate, it will take 300 years to attain gender equality” (Malekpour et al. 2023, 250). Accelerated transformations are required to reach goals necessary to avoid increasingly frequent and costly climate change disasters (United Nations 2023). It is not plausible to do real-world experiments at the global scale required to infer which strategies work best in which situations.\nIn this course we will focus on deducing how between different cognitive and social factors, or other initial conditions, affect simulated sustainability intervention outcomes. We will frame our studies in terms of sustainable development goals, but we will never fit our models to observations. Nonetheless, we will strive to develop models that are amenable to real-world interventions against which the models could be fit and predictions could be compared. It seems this is not done too much in practice yet in sustainability. However, some of our colleagues focused on studying basic processes that underlie cultural transmission do exactly this to explain experimental data and archaeological observations (Deffner et al. 2024), which thereby improves their theory, models, and understanding of cultural evolution in a theory-model-observation cycle. With more time and research effort, this cycle may become commonplace in sustainability.\nThe urgent need to understand how sustainable behaviors spread in order to develop effective interventions pressures social scientists to make social science more rigorous, reliable, and digestible by non-social scientists. In the rest of this Introduction we review cognitive and social theories of social learning, identity and influence, homophily and core-periphery network structures, and preview the remainder of the course material. For an overview of the course feel free to skip ahead to the Plan in table format.\n\n\nContagion\nFor contagion, adoption occurs when a legacy-doer encounters an adaptive-doer and switches with probability \\(\\alpha\\), while dropping occurs when an adaptive-doer reverts to the legacy behavior with probability \\(\\delta\\), regardless of prevalence.\n\nAdoption probability:\n\\[\nP(A \\mid L) = \\alpha a\n\\]\nDrop probability:\n\\[\nP(L \\mid A) = \\delta\n\\]\n\nNormalizing:\n\\[\nP(A) = (1-a) P(A \\mid L) + a P(A \\mid A),\n\\]\nwith \\(P(A \\mid A) = 1 - \\delta\\), we obtain the prevalence dynamic\n\\[\n\\dot a = \\alpha a (1-a) - \\delta a.\n\\]\n\n\nSuccess-biased Learning\nAdoption depends on both prevalence and relative success.\n\nAdoption probability:\n\\[\nP(A \\mid L) \\propto a f_A\n\\]\nDrop probability:\n\\[\nP(L \\mid A) \\propto (1-a) f_L\n\\]\n\nNormalizing by total “success weight” \\(\\bar f = af_A + (1-a)f_L\\):\n\\[\nP(A) = \\frac{a f_A}{\\bar f},\n\\]\nyielding the prevalence dynamic\n\\[\n\\dot a = \\frac{a f_A}{\\bar f} - a = \\frac{a}{\\bar f}(f_A - \\bar f).\n\\]\n\n\nConformity\nAdoption depends on the relative prevalence of behaviors, weighted by conformity strength \\(\\gamma\\).\n\nAdoption probability:\n\\[\nP(A \\mid L) \\propto a^{1+\\gamma}\n\\]\nDrop probability:\n\\[\nP(L \\mid A) \\propto (1-a)^{1+\\gamma}\n\\]\n\nNormalizing:\n\\[\nP(A) = \\frac{a^{1+\\gamma}}{a^{1+\\gamma} + (1-a)^{1+\\gamma}},\n\\]\nso the prevalence dynamic is\n\\[\n\\dot a = \\frac{a^{1+\\gamma}}{a^{1+\\gamma} + (1-a)^{1+\\gamma}} - a.\n\\]\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Measuring Collective Adaptation\nTo make sense of different learning models, we need to decide what to measure. The prevalence dynamic generates several observables: - Prevalence of adaptive behavior over time, \\(a(t)\\).\n- Fitness or success values of behaviors, if defined (\\(f_A\\), \\(f_L\\)).\n- Transition probabilities, such as \\(P(A \\mid L)\\) and \\(P(L \\mid A)\\).\nFrom these observables, we define outcome measures that summarize how well an adaptive behavior spreads: - Success rate: the probability that the adaptive behavior eventually becomes common or dominant.\n- Time to fixation (or last time step): how long it takes, if ever, for the adaptive behavior to be adopted by everyone.\nStudying these outcomes requires what we call a computational experiment. A computational experiment specifies a learning model, population assumptions, and initial conditions, then runs the model forward to see what happens. By repeating the experiment under different conditions, we can compare the effects of learning rules, population size, or network structure.",

    "text": "4.1 Cooperation as a correlative coordination problem\nIn California’s Central Valley, farms, orchards, dairies, and other agricultural industries use disproportionately more water than the communities where farm workers live in an increasingly precarious state. Wells increasingly run dry when they aren’t contaminated by deadly chemicals first. The state-level water restriction enforcement agency has recently rejected several plans proposed by local water district planners. All this currently occurs against a backdrop of climate variability and political instability that increasingly drives the migration of farmers and farm workers alike (see CA Central Valley water annotated references and links below). This problem is increasingly acute across diverse societies and aquifers, though in some cases groundwater is being restored to previously overdrawn aquifers (Jasechko et al. 2024).\nEquitable access to clean potable water depends on cooperation among those sharing groundwater aquifers, consistent with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to Reduce Inequalities (SDG 10) and to provide Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 6), representing Group I and Group B goals to, in general, support infrastructure/institutions and basic human needs, respectively. Cooperation to sustain groundwater resources is increasingly important since there are more frequent climate change-driven droughts threatening human and non-human life on land. This project, then, also addresses Group E (environmental and ecological protection) Sustainable Development Goals, namely to accelerate relevant Climate Action (SDG 13), and to protect the literal bedrock of ecosystems that support all Life on Land (SDG 15).\nTheoretically, we know that high rates of migration can disrupt the formation of cooperative communities in idealized models of the establishment and diffusion of cooperation to effectively form collectives. However, many theoretical questions remain and existing results have not yet been interpreted for how they could support sustainability in any way, including groundwater sustainability. We therefore develop here a spatial agent-based model of cooperation where agents represent water consumers arranged on a spatial grid. Migration is represented as a random switch of two agents in the grid. Cooperation or its opposite, defection, result in different payoffs depending on which of these two behaviors interaction partners choose. Cooperation can be mutually beneficial, but it comes at the cost of an initial investment that will be uncompensated if a model interaction partner defects. If both individuals defect, i.e., choose to not cooperate, then they may face a disaster debit, i.e., a penalty that could represent, e.g., ecological collapse, external sanctions, or some other form of penalty.\nWe analyze how migration can break up cooperatives, i.e., blocks of cooperating agents who assort to effectively block out those who intend to defect. We characterize the effect of migration rate for a range of costs of cooperation. This basic analysis lays the groundwork for designing interventions that help maintain cooperation even with frequent migration (see Exercise 3).\nCooperation is a correlative coordination problem, meaning that payoffs are maximized when individuals do the same behavior as others. Cooperation dilemmas, in evolutionary game theory on which we draw here, are defined to entail the risk of betrayal, where defectors are those in society who reap the benefit of costly contributions of others, but not contributing anything themselves. The more general correlative coordination problems do not necessarily entail risk of betrayal in the same sense. For example, deciding which side of the street to drive on: it doesn’t matter which side, so long as everyone does that. There is no immediate “cost” to driving on the agreed-to side of the road, only benefit that you’ll be sure to avoid crashing head-on with others, so long as they correlate their behavior with yours, i.e., with some societal norm.\nIt is costly to cooperate with groundwater pumping limits from the point of view of agricultural producers. For example, less water input might mean lower almond yield and fewer profits in the short term. If enough other orchards defect, this could lead to dry wells, and it would prove to have been unwise to cooperate since defectors made the most money while it lasted, multiplied in effect if defectors evaded accountability for their behavior.",

    "text": "4.1.1 Cultural evolutionary game theory\nUnder success-biased learning, culture can be said to evolve. A behavior is like a phenotype, and knowledge of or capacity for a behavior is like genes or alleles that encode a phenotype. Fitness in either case is the benefit received from the phenotype expression.\nTo study how the prevalence of cooperation varies over time and as \\(t \\to \\infty\\), we assume each agent does one of two behaviors: Cooperate or Defect. In our approach here and in many cases, it is unnecessary to represent knowledge of how to cooperate itself, including the acquisition of this knowledge. In other words, doing a behavior implies having already learned how to do it. This strategic abstraction is called the phenotypic gambit, with “gambit” really meaning something more like “assumption”.\n\n\n4.1.2 Inspiration behind this article\nOne of the goals of this article is to demonstrate socmod use by analyzing a game theory model of cooperation between agents on a spatial grid. The other goal is to motivate the study with a real-world sustainability problem, groundwater conservation. The model and analysis is inspired by Ch. 6 in Paul Smaldino’s book Modeling Social Behavior, including some of the exercises below that Paul includes in his analysis: Paul’s model is written in NetLogo, with analysis and visualizations done in R, it appears.

Agents are located at grid points in a rectangular 2D lattice, though we use a square lattice with \\(L=21\\) agents per side in our analysis here. Agents play a cooperation game, known as the prisoner’s dilemma game, a common game theory representation of cooperation where a focal agent gets a benefit \\(b \\in [0, \\infty)\\) if their interaction partner cooperates, but the focal agent pays a cost \\(-c\\) if they choose to cooperate, where \\(c\\in[0, \\infty)\\). The payoffs from combinations of the four possible combinations of (Cooperate/Defect) x (Cooperate/Defect) for the dyad define the game’s payoff matrix (Table 4.1).\n\n4.2.1 Spatial structure\nSpatial structure, we hypothesize, provides the substrate for cooperation to take hold since neighbors can form spatially organized cooperatives, i.e., clusters of contiguous, connected cooperators. We represent spatial structure by locating agent nodes in a two-dimensional lattice graph we set to be square with side length \\(L\\), so the agent population size is \\(N = L^2\\). The model grid can be rectangular in general, and it is left as an exercise to the reader to test what happens when \\(N\\) is held constant but the aspect ratio of the grid is varied, i.e., the width divided by the height.\nFirst consider a grid with \\(L=6\\) agents per side, so \\(N=36\\) population size.\n\nsource(\"R/cooperation/model.R\")\n\nL = 6\n\nplot_example_adoptnet &lt;- function(abm, layout = igraph::on_grid()) {\n  plot_network_adoption(\n    abm, \n    layout = layout,\n    behaviors = c(\"Cooperate\", \"Defect\"), \n    behavior_colors = c(\"#0486C1\", \"#D38855\")\n  )\n}\n\n# Using defaults coop_benefit = 1.0 and coop_cost = 0.2\nabm &lt;- make_cooperation_model(grid_width = L, grid_height = L)\nplot_example_adoptnet(abm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can make a rectangle with the same number of agents like so\n\nabm &lt;- make_cooperation_model(grid_width = 9, grid_height = 4)\nplot_example_adoptnet(abm, layout = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Social interaction and payoffs\nAgents interact with all of their neighbors on each time step, collecting payoffs according to whether an agent and each neighbor is currently doing the “Cooperate” or “Defect” behavior, or equivalently whether each agent is a cooperator or defector.\n\n# Have the focal_agent play the coordination game with all neighbors\nplay_game_with_neighbors &lt;- function(focal_agent, model) {\n  # Focal agent plays game with neighbors, accumulating payoffs\n  total_payoff &lt;- \n    sum(unlist(\n      # Use the Neighbors$map function to play with all neighbors\n      focal_agent$get_neighbors()$map(\n        \\(n) play_game(focal_agent, n, model)\n      )\n    ))\n  # Focal agent's fitness gets set to the total_payoff\n  focal_agent$fitness_current &lt;- total_payoff\n}\n\nThey receive payoffs resulting from play_game, which are given in Table 4.1 in terms of the benefit to cooperation, \\(\\beta\\), the cost of cooperation, \\(\\gamma\\), and the disaster debit \\(-\\delta\\), where \\(\\beta,\\gamma,\\delta \\in [0, \\infty)\\). For our initial study here we will set \\(\\delta = 0\\), leaving an examination of how cooperation prevalence is affected for different values of \\(\\delta &gt; 0\\) as an exercise.\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Payoff matrix in dyadic interactions to focal agent, \\(i\\), whose behavior is read across rows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocal \\(\\downarrow\\quad\\quad\\) Partner \\(\\rightarrow\\)\n\\(b_j = \\text{Cooperate}\\)\n\\(b_j = \\text{Defect}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(b_i = \\text{Cooperate}\\)\n\\(\\beta - \\gamma\\)\n\\(-\\gamma\\)\n\n\n\\(b_i = \\text{Defect}\\)\n\\(\\beta\\)\n\\(-\\delta\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe play_game function is defined as follows:\n\n# Two individuals play game with one another; b = coop_benefit, c = coop_cost\nplay_game &lt;- function(focal_agent, partner_agent, model) {\n  return (\n    model$payoff_matrix[\n      focal_agent$behavior_current,\n      partner_agent$behavior_current\n    ]\n  )\n}\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Selection for cooperation via social learning\nWe implement success-biased learning here in a custom model_step function called coop_model_step used as the sole defining function for the LearningStrategy I call coop_game_strategy. coop_game_strategy uses NULL functions for partner_selection, since agents interact with all neighbors, and also for interaction, since agents accumulate payoffs over all interactions with neighbors. Both of these are implemented in the coop_model_step function that defines this learning strategy’s model_step named constructor parameter (full definition of coop_model_step is given in the Appendix).\n\n# For this normal game in this format we don't have individual partner selection \n# and interaction steps. Instead all is handled in the model_step, \n# i.e., coop_model_step defined below\ncoop_game_strategy &lt;- make_model_dynamics(\n  partner_selection = \\(f, m) NULL,\n  interaction = \\(f, p, m) NULL,\n  model_step = coop_model_step,\n  label = \"Normal game strategy\"\n)\n\n\n\n4.2.4 Computational analysis design\nTo analyze how cooperation cost and migration rate affect the emergence of cooperatives in a spatial grid, we systematically vary these variables (Table 4.2) and observe the dynamics of cooperation prevalence over time and our main outcome measure, the prevalence of cooperators at \\(t=50\\), \\(p_C(t=50)\\) (Table 4.4). Specifically we first vary the cost of cooperation, \\(\\gamma\\), setting the migration rate \\(\\mu = 0.0\\), and observe the results. Second, we vary \\(\\mu\\), setting \\(\\gamma = 0.2\\), and observe the results.\n\n\n4.2.5 Model parameters\nThe model parameters specify how agent learning and migration behavior work. They also set the size of the grid, which indirectly sets the number of agents. We systematically vary two of these, \\(\\gamma\\) and \\(\\mu\\), and observe the dynamics and outcomes to implement our computational experiments.\n\n\n\nTable 4.2: Model parameter descriptions and settings.

    "text": "4.3 Analysis\nTo understand how the perceived risk or cost of cooperation and the mutation rate each affect the emergence of cooperation, we examined how cooperation cost and migration rate separately affect the emergence and maintenance of cooperation in simulated populations. We confirmed computationally that at or beyond critical cooperation cost, \\(\\gamma_c = \\beta / 4\\), stable cooperatives cannot form, the defect behavior fixates, and cooperation goes extinct (Figure 4.1 A). A similar analysis of a minimal five-agent “cross” or “plus” cooperative is unstable if \\(2\\beta &gt; 4\\beta - 4\\gamma\\), i.e., if \\(\\gamma &gt; \\beta / 2\\) (Figure 4.1 B). This explains why we observe such a sharp transition from widespread cooperation to zero cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Defector-turns-cooperator and cooperator-turns defector conditions in the founding and destruction of cooperatives. Three cooperators in a line will result in new cooperators adjacent to the middle node of the triad if the cost of cooperation is less one quarter of the cooperation benefit, i.e., \\(\\gamma &lt; \\gamma_c = \\beta / 4\\) (A). A five-agent “cross” cooperative is unstable if the cost of cooperation is greater than half of the benefit: \\(\\gamma &gt; \\beta / 2\\).\n\n\n\n\n4.3.1 When does cost of cooperation become prohibitive?\nWe see that cooperation emerges at various non-zero equilibrium values for cooperation costs up to 0.25, including up to 0.249 (Figure 4.3)! In our initial conditions with half of the agents starting as cooperators, the prevalence of cooperators decreases initially as the relatively isolated cooperators become defectors (Figure 4.2). Then more and more agents join nascent cooperatives, so the prevalence eventually begins to increase again. When cooperation cost is 0, the dip is lowest, and cooperatives begin to grow and expand cooperator prevalence to their maximum values earlier on compared to greater cooperation costs with \\(\\gamma &lt; \\beta / 4\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Dynamics of cooperator prevalence as a function of cooperation cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Dynamics of cooperator prevalence as a function of cooperation cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 When does migration undermine cooperation?\nMigration, as hypothesized, can undermine cooperation. Based on our reasoning to explain why cooperation is only supported up to \\(\\gamma = 0.25\\), we see that for cooperators to spread, there must be at least three lined up to seed a cooperative that grows into a cluster of cooperators. For this particular choice of parameters, cooperatives can reliably grow only when the migration rate is less than 0.125 (Figure 4.5), but there is high variability in the cooperator prevalence as \\(\\mu\\) approaches 0.125, indicating that the cooperatives are unstable (Figure 4.4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Cooperator prevalence dynamics as a function of migration rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Cooperator prevalence at \\(t=50\\) over migration rate.

    "text": "4.4 Discussion\nWe found that there exist critical cooperation cost/risk values that, when exceeded, cause cooperation to collapse. If we intend to use these models to promote climate action via sustainable adaptations, then this guides us to focus on (1) the perceived cost or risk of cooperation to farmers and municipalities; and (2) the induced migration patterns induced by climate change and other risk factor in the California groundwater case.\nThis model made several strategic assumptions to make it tractable to analyze, however these were selected at the exclusion of other factors. See the Exercises below for a review of some details we left out and a guide to exploring alternative assumptions on your own.\n\nCultural evolution in agriculture (Waring work) and how cooperatives form (Waring, Goff, and Smaldino 2017). Social behavior science-inspired field work for ecosystem protection Bujold, Williamson, and Thulin (2020).\n(broader implications) This indicates we should be focusing groundwater recharge on the areas with the most amenable geological qualities for replenishing the groundwater aquifers (Stanford Doerr news brief summarizing Rosemary Knight’s research, “Scientists map fastest pathways for replenishing Central Valley groundwater”)\n\nWhen space structures interactions, large cooperatives can emerge starting from a few pioneer cooperators. The emergence of cooperatives requires that (1) cooperation be cheap, and (2) cooperators remain in cooperatives sufficiently for a sufficiently long time. Our idealized model of space, social interaction, and migration rigorously proved these theoretical claims to be correct. This modeling approach serves as a template for future work with more serious applications. See the Exercises for some ideas on how to extend the model to include ecological disaster penalties when two cooperators interact, and how to represent different size grids with loose connections, creating a sort of small-world network using rewiring.",

    "text": "4.5 Exercises\n\nExercise 1: Disastrous defection\nHow do you think adding a defection disaster penalty, \\(\\delta &gt; 0\\), will affect the prevalence of cooperation in simulations? Develop a computational experiment to investigate how cooperation prevalence is affected for different values of \\(\\delta &gt; 0\\). Hint: use run_trials, specifying, e.g., disaster_debit = c(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0), then summarise over disaster_debit in summarise_dynamics or summarise_outcomes and plot, e.g., the mean prevalence at time \\(t=200\\), or whatever is appropriate.\nDo larger values of \\(\\delta\\) make cooperation more common? If so, how great must \\(\\delta\\) be in order to maintain no-migration cooperation levels for a given migration frequency?\n\n\nExercise 2: The shape of cooperation\n\nCreate a new computational experiment with this model where you hold \\(N\\) constant but vary the aspect ratio of the grid. For example, if we use 1024 agents we can have a square grid, aspect ratio 1, if we use \\(W=H=\\) where \\(W\\) is width and \\(H\\) is height. We can generate several other aspect ratios, as shown in the screenshot below. Approximately the same number of agents also works, for example, a 10x6 or 11x6 rectangle has approximately the same number of agents as 8x8 = 64.\nThis spatial grid has hard/non-periodic boundaries, i.e., agents at the edge have only three neighbors, and the four corner agents have only two neighbors. What effect would you hypothesize if we made our grid into a tourus which is essentially the 2D surface of a donut so there are no corners or edges. This can be specified using by setting periodic = TRUE in igraph::make_lattice when you specify the ABM graph.\n\nIf you want a larger population with more aspect ratios, that will take a longer time to run, but provides more possible combinations to test.\n\n\n\n4.5.1 Exercise 3: Reciprocity\nReciprocity can increase selection pressure towards cooperation, whereby agents can adapt their behavior with different partners depending on their cooperation history over several rounds of interactions (Nowak 2006). In other words, an agent will cooperate with those who have cooperated with them in past interactions, but defect against those who have defected agains them. There are many ways this could be implemented. The most famous is called tit-for-tat, which is the strategy where an agent will initially cooperate with a stranger, but if a partner defects against a focal agent, that focal agent will forever defect when partnered with the defecting partner. Implement tit-for-tat as a factor in agent behavior selection strategy, either in place of or in addition to social learning.\n\n\n4.5.2 Exercise 4: Interconnected communities\nThere could be cooperation or defection between communities as well as within communities. In this exercise, create two or more independent grids, then connect the grids probabilistically. For example, you might set a between_grid_connect_prob that an edge exists between any two agents/nodes from different grids. How does cooperation change with different numbers and sizes of grids, and between-grid connection probability?\nStart with the following demo command to create two grids with different sizes and create a “disjoint union” of the graphs with the %du% command in igraph. One can then rewire the union of the two grids as follows to create interconnected grids.\n\nlibrary(igraph)\ngraph &lt;- \n  igraph::make_lattice(dimvector=c(5, 4), periodic = FALSE) %du%\n  igraph::make_lattice(dimvector=c(6, 3), periodic = FALSE) %&gt;%\n  igraph::rewire(igraph::each_edge(p = 0.025, loops = FALSE))\n# Set id attribute of graphs so it's in the graph\nV(graph)$id &lt;- 1:length(V(graph))\ntbl &lt;- ggnetwork::ggnetwork(graph)\n\nggplot2::ggplot(\n    tbl, ggplot2::aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend)\n  ) + \n  ggnetwork::geom_edges() + \n  ggnetwork::geom_nodes(color = \"#347754\", size = 8) + \n  ggnetwork::geom_nodetext(ggplot2::aes(label = id), color = \"white\") + \n  ggplot2::theme_void()",

    "text": "About the Project\nSocial Science for Sustainability by Matt Turner emerged from the need for a simple, but powerful and interdisciplinary social science to teach sustainability researchers and students quantitative social science. This includes necessary computational and cognitive science topics sustainability practicioners need to know because they matter for decision making in partnerships, institutions, in governments, and online.\nI emphasize in the title that this only my take by including my name, Matt Turner. I want this to be anti-colonial. I am trying to liberate social science from disciplinary gatekeepers, not trying to become a gatekeeper, myself. I want you to be inspired to create your own Social Science for Sustainability by {Your Name Here}. In some social science disciplines, it seems there are some “holy books” that, convention states, must be cited and whose approach must be adopted. If my version of Social Science doesn’t work for you, don’t use it! Make up your own and show how it helps. Or maybe suggest ideas for this version.\nThat being said, I think the version in this project could be especially useful. I have put years into trying to understand the details of how social science can help us in our existential crisis of accelerating unsustainability, which perhaps has already spiraled beyond all control.",

    "text": "About the Author, Matt\nI am a scientist and educator dedicated to resilient, rigorous, and problem-focused social science. I am currently a Lecturer in Environmental Social Sciences at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability at Stanford University.\nIn many ways my career has built up to this point. From my physics and mathematics training I learned to use equations to calculate and understand collective dynamics, and an intuition for how to construct mechanistic scientific models of reality. As a professional software developer I upgraded my programming technicques along with domain knowledge of economics and environmental and earth sciences. In my PhD training I began consolidating all this, along with a strenuous training in social, cognitive, and behavioral sciences.\nUntil receiving my PhD in Cognitive and Information Sciences in 2021, I got my kicks cultivating a beginner’s mind by switching majors, careers, disciplines, cities, and more. All the while, many peers focused their efforts towards developing deeper expertise in fewer topics. My PhD work was the beginning of the synthesis of my work up to that point. The work presented in this Book, Curriculum, and other materials, is a continuation and extention.\nThis work was made possible by my time spent as a postdoctoral scholar mentored by James Holland Jones, with funding from a Stanford Medicine Pandemic Preparedness Hub Fellowship that enabled me to even kickstart a project to cross even more disciplinary and international borders studying urban Indigenous infection dynamics in Brazil. I hope to continue to build my collaboration with my Brazilian colleagues and expand my collaboration to include more scientists from the United States and Brazil for cultural and scientific exchange. People in these two countries face many similar cultural challenges as the largest democracies in the Americas. I myself got to spend summer 2008 learning Portuguese and living and working on astrophysics research in Brazil.\nI am motivated by a deep and humbling sense of duty to present essential social science material with a minimum cognitive overhead a maximum real-world impact. This job requires a diverse background like mine to understand the science, mathematics, computation, and philosophy of all the various social science disciplines that have something to contribute.",

    "text": "Closing: Consilience\nThis work implements a method of consilient, strategic curation of social science. Curation is a type of consolidation. In terms of scientific theories, this means the theory uses fewer types of imagined things, processes, or situations to predict real-world observations. For example, the theory of quantum mechanics consolidates physics research, helping us understand research in atomic physics and chemistry can be explained by a common set of mathematical models and computational tools.\nWhen we consolidtate theories, in social science or physics, we get a default benefit of having fewer ideas, or mental “things”, we have to keep track of in our limited working memory. Consilience is the added benefit that we often see unpredictably useful and aesthetically beautiful connections between what seemed to be disconnected scientific phenomena. In other words, a consilient theory is more than just the sum of its parts.",
