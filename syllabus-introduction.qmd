# 1. *Introduction to Social Science for Sustainability* {.unnumbered}

*Autumn 2025 (September 22 – December 20)*  

This is the **introductory course** in the *Social Science for Sustainability* curriculum.  
It combines theory, computational modeling, and case studies to help you understand how social processes shape sustainable futures — and how we can intervene.

Enrollment is **free**. Just subscribe on [Substack](https://matphd.substack.com) to receive weekly lectures and resources.  

The educational materials, the `socmod` R package, and any research we produce will always be **openly available**.


### Course Overview

This course develops a framework for understanding **how collective behavior emerges** and **how adaptation spreads** in human systems.  
You’ll learn how to connect models of cultural evolution, cooperation, and coordination to sustainability challenges.


### Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, you’ll be able to:

- Understand how different **social learning processes** can promote or inhibit the **diffusion of adaptive behaviors**  
- Analyze how **networks and social structure** shape cooperation, coordination, and collective decision-making  
- Use agent-based and mathematical models to explore **policy interventions** for sustainability  
- Critically evaluate models and evidence to distinguish between robust findings and misleading results
